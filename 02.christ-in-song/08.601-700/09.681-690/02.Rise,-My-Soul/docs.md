## 682. RISE, MY SOUL

```txt
1.
Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings,
Thy better portion trace;
Rise from transitory things
Tow'rds heav'n thy native place.
Sun and moon and stars decay,
Time shall soon this earth remove;
Rise, my soul, and haste away
To joys prepared above.

2.
Rivers to the ocean run,
Nor stay in all their course;
Fire ascending seeks the sun;
Both speed them to their source:
So my soul, derived from God.
Pants to view His glorious face,
Forward tends to His abode,
To rest in His embrace.

3.
Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn,
Press onward to the prize;
Soon our Saviour will return
Triumphant in the skies.
Yet a season, and you know
Happy entrance will be giv'n,
All our sorrows left below,
And earth exchanged for heav'n.
```
