## 647. EVENING PRAYER

```txt
1.
Saviour, breathe an evening blessing,
Ere repose our spirits seal:
Sin and want we come confessing,
Thou canst save and Thou canst heal.

2.
Tho' destruction walk around us,
Tho' the arrows past us fly;
Angel guards from Thee surround us,
We are safe if Thou art nigh.

3.
Tho' the night be dark and dreary,
Darkness cannot hide from Thee;
Thou art He who, never weary,
Watchest where Thy people be.

4.
Should swift death this night o'ertake us,
And our couch become our tomb,
May the morn of glory wake us,
Clad in heav'n's eternal bloom.
