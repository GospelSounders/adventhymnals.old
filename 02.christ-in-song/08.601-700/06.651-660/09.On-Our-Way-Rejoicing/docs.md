## 659. ON OUR WAY REJOICING

```txt
1.
On our way rejoicing,
As we homeward move,
Hearken to our praises,
O thou God of love!
Is there grief or sadness?
Thine it cannot be!
Is our sky beclouded?
Clouds are not from Thee!

Refrain:
On our way rejoicing,
As we homeward move,
Hearken to our praises,
O Thou God of love!

2.
If with honest-hearted
Love for God and man,
Day by day Thou find us
Doing what we can;
Thou who giv'st the seed-time
Wilt give large increase,
Crown the head with blessings
Fill the heart with peace. 

Refrain:
On our way rejoicing,
As we homeward move,
Hearken to our praises,
O Thou God of love!


3.
On our way rejoicing
Gladly let us go;
Conquered hath our leader,
Vanquished is our foe!
Christ without, our safety;
Christ within, our joy;
Who, if we be faithful,
Can our hope destroy? 

Refrain:
On our way rejoicing,
As we homeward move,
Hearken to our praises,
O Thou God of love!


4.
Unto God the Father
Joyful songs we sing;
Unto God the Saviour
Thankful hearts we bring.
Unto God the Spirit
Bow we and adore,
On our way rejoicing
Now and evermore! 

Refrain:
On our way rejoicing,
As we homeward move,
Hearken to our praises,
O Thou God of love!
