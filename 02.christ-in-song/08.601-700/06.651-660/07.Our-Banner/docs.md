## 657. OUR BANNER

```txt
1.
Brightly gleams our banner,
Pointing to the sky,
Waving wand'rers onward,
To their home on high;
Journ'ying o'er the desert,
Gladly thus we pray,
And with hearts united,
Take our heav'nward way.

Chorus:
Brightly gleams our banner,
Pointing to the sky,
Waving wand'rers onward
To their home on high.

2.
Jesus, Lord and Master;
At Thy sacred feet,
Here with hearts rejoicing,
See Thy children meet;
Often have we left Thee,
Often gone astray,
Keep us, mighty Saviour,
In the narrow way. 

Chorus:
Brightly gleams our banner,
Pointing to the sky,
Waving wand'rers onward
To their home on high.


3.
All our days direct us
In the way we go,
Lead us on victorious,
Over every foe;
Bid Thine angels shield us,
When the storm clouds low'r,
Pardon Thou, and save us
In the final hour. 

Chorus:
Brightly gleams our banner,
Pointing to the sky,
Waving wand'rers onward
To their home on high.
