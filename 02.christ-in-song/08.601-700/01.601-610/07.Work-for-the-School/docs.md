## 607. WORK FOR THE SCHOOL

```txt
1.
Let us work for the school with our hearts and our hands;
For its praises are sung by the good in all lands
Let it never, no never, decline;
That are blest with the gospel divine.
Rally then, rally then, stand by the school;
Why should it languish and die?
Rally then, rally then, stand by the school;
Why should it languish and die?

2.
'Tis perfum'd by the pray'rs, 'tis bedewed by the tears
They rejoiced at its hopes, and they mourned at its fears,
Of the holy, the active, the true;
When its friends were but feeble and few.
Rally then, rally then, stand by the school;
Why should it languish and die?
Rally then, rally then, stand by the school;
Why should it languish and die?

3.
Now the sunshine of favor illumines its path
'Tis a source of her weal, 'tis a source of her worth,
And the church spreads above it her wing;
And a gem in the crown of her King.
Rally then, rally then, stand by the school;
Why should it languish and die?
Rally then, rally then, stand by the school;
Why should it languish and die?
