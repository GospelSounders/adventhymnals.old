## 609. I NEED THEE EVERY HOUR

```txt
1.
I need Thee every hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.

Refrain:
I need Thee, O I need Thee!
Every hour I need Thee;
O bless me now, my Saviour!
I come to Thee.

2.
I need Thee every hour;
Stay Thou near by;
Temptations lose their pow'r
When Thou art nigh. 

Refrain:
I need Thee, O I need Thee!
Every hour I need Thee;
O bless me now, my Saviour!
I come to Thee.


3.
I need Thee every hour,
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain. 

Refrain:
I need Thee, O I need Thee!
Every hour I need Thee;
O bless me now, my Saviour!
I come to Thee.


4.
I need Thee every hour;
Teach me Thy will,
And Thy rich promises
In me fulfil. 

Refrain:
I need Thee, O I need Thee!
Every hour I need Thee;
O bless me now, my Saviour!
I come to Thee.


5.
I need Thee every hour,
Most Holy One;
O make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son. 

Refrain:
I need Thee, O I need Thee!
Every hour I need Thee;
O bless me now, my Saviour!
I come to Thee.
