## 622. WHY STAND WITH RUSTY BLADE?

```txt
1.
Ho!  reaper of life's harvest,
Why stand with rusty blade,
Until the night draws round thee,
And day begins to fade?
Why stand ye idle, waiting
For reapers more to come?
The golden morn is passing,
Why stand ye idle, dumb?

2.
Come down from hill and mountain,
In morning's ruddy glow,
Nor wait until the dial
Points to the noon below;
And come with the strong sinew,
Nor faint in heat or cold;
And pause not till the evening
Draws round its wealth of gold.

3.
Mount up the hights of wisdom,
And crush each error low;
Keep back no words of knowledge
That human hearts should know;
Be faithful to thy mission,
In service of thy Lord,
And soon a golden chaplet
Will be thy rich reward.

```
