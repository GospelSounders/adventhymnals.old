## 623. OUR ENDEAVOR

```txt
1.
For Christ is our endeavor,
Our hearts to Him belong;
His presence cheers us ever,
His love inspires our song;
We come in youth's bright morning,
Obedient to His word,
And seek for our adorning,
The beauty of the Lord.

2.
In fulness of His blessing,
Good work for Him we'll do;
His name with joy confessing,
His standard bearers true;
And He will never fail us,
Whatever may betide;
Tho' danger should assail us,
In Him we safe abide.

3.
So with youth's ardor showing,
We form a Christian band;
The mind of Jesus knowing,
We for His honor stand;
For He is our Endeavor,
And to Him we belong,
Whose grace shall fail us never,
Whose love inspires our song.
