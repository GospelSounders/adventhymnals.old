## 188. GOD SHALL BE FIRST

```txt
1.
God shall be first in ev'rything;
No other gods before him;
Creator and Redeemer King,
'Tis pleasure to adore him.

2.
First when with rosy morn I wake,
His pow'r mine eyes unsealing;
First when his bounteous gifts I take,
His Father love revealing.

3.
First when the crowding cares of day
Impatient press upon me;
First when the gentle twilight ray
With peaceful calm falls on me.

4.
First when I leave mortality,
The glad new song upraising;
First all Eternity, where we
Shall dwell who here are praising.
