## 192. HE BROUGHT ME OUT

```txt
1.
My heart was distress'd neath Jehovah's dread frown,
And low in the pit where my sins dragg'd me down;
I cried to the Lord from the deep miry clay,
Who tenderly brought me out to golden day.

Chorus:
He brought me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul to-day,
A song of praise, hallelujah!

2.
He placed me upon the strong Rock by His side,
My steps were established and here I'll abide;
No danger of falling while here I remain,
But stand by His grace until the crown I gain. 

Chorus:
He brought me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul to-day,
A song of praise, hallelujah!


3.
He gave me a song, 'twas a new song of praise.
By day and by night its sweet notes I will raise;
My heart's overflowing, I'm happy and free,
I'll praise my Redeemer, who has rescued me. 

Chorus:
He brought me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul to-day,
A song of praise, hallelujah!


4.
I'll sing of His wonderful mercy to me,
I'll praise Him till all men His goodness shall see;
I'll sing of salvation at home and abroad,
Till many shall hear the truth and trust in God. 

Chorus:
He brought me out of the miry clay,
He set my feet on the Rock to stay;
He puts a song in my soul to-day,
A song of praise, hallelujah!
