## 117. COMFORT TO THE DREARY

```txt
1.
O, Comfort to the dreary!
O, Joy to the oppressed!
"Come unto Me, ye weary,
And I will give you rest."
O, come with all your weakness,
Come with your load of woe;
And learn if him with meekness
All righteousness to know.

3.
Ye who the world have courted,
And suffer'd from its spite;
Ye who with sin have sported,
And felt its serpent bite;
Come, learn, your follies quitting,
That this world's gain is loss;
To Christ's light yoke submitting,
Come, and take up the cross. 

4.
O come and make the trial;
Christ's service is release;
If hard the self denial,
Its fruit is joy and peace.
His word your faith defending,
Shall serve you for the strife;
Peace all your steps attending;
The prime, eternal life!
