## 134. BAPTIZE US ANEW

```txt
1.
Baptize us anew
With pow'r from on high,
With love, O refresh us!
Dear Saviour, draw nigh.

Chorus:
We humbly beseech thee, Lord, Jesus, we pray,
With love and the Spirit baptize us to-day.

2.
Unworthy we cry,
Unholy, unclean, 
O wash us and cleanse us
From sin's guilty stain. 

Chorus:
We humbly beseech thee, Lord, Jesus, we pray,
With love and the Spirit baptize us to-day.


3.
O heavenly dove,
Descend from on high!
We plead thy rich blessing;
In mercy draw nigh. 

Chorus:
We humbly beseech thee, Lord, Jesus, we pray,
With love and the Spirit baptize us to-day.


4.
O list the glad voice!
From heaven it came:
Thou art my beloved,
Well pleased I am.

Chorus:
We praise thee, we bless the, dear Lamb that was slain
We land and adore thee, Amen and Amen.
