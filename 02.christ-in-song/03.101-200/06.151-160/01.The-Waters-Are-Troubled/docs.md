## 151. THE WATERS ARE TROUBLED

```txt
1.
The waters are troubled,
The angel is here;
The fountain of mercy
Flows healing and clear:
O come in your sorrow,
And come in your sin;
The waters are troubled:
Step in, O step in!

2.
The waters are troubled,
No longer delay;
The fountain of mercy
Has healing today;
Then why will you linger,
Since lift you may win?
The waters are troubled:
Step in, O step in!

3.
The waters are troubled
The angel still waits;
He pauses in peril
Who halts and debates,
Give over your falt'ring,
Your struggles within;
The waters are troubled:
Step in, O step in!
