## 175. ANGELS HOVERING ROUND

```txt
1.
There are angels hov'ring round,
There are angels hov'ring round,
There are angels, angels hov'ring round.

2.
To carry the tidings home,
To the New Jerusalem,
There are, etc.

3.
Let him that heareth, come,
O come, while yet there's room;
There are, etc.
```
