## 180. COME TO ME

```txt
1.
With tearful eyes I look around;
Life seems a dark and stormy sea,
Yet, mid the gloom, I hear a sound,
A heavenly whisper, "Come to me."

2.
It tells me of a place of rest;
It tells me where my soul may flee:
O, to the weary, faint, oppressed,
How sweet the bidding, "Come to me.

3.
"Come, for all else must fail and die!
Earth is no resting place for thee;
To heav'n direct thy weeping eye,
I am thy portion; come to me."

4.
O voice of mercy!  voice of love!
In conflict, grief, and agony,
Support me, cheer me from above!
And gently whisper, "Come to me."
