## 165. COME TO THE LIVING WATERS

```txt
1.
Come to the living waters, come!
Obey your Maker's call;
Return, ye weary wand'rers, home;
My grace is free for all,
My grace is free for all.

2.
Nothing ye in exchange shall give;
Leave all you have behind;
Freely the gift of God receive,
And peace in Jesus find,
And peace in Jesus find.

3.
I bid you all my goodness prove;
My promises are free:
Come, taste the manna of my love,
Delight your souls in me,
Delight your souls in me.
```
