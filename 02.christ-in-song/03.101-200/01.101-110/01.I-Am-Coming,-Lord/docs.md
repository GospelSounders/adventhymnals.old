## 101. I AM COMING, LORD

```txt
1.
I hear thy welcome voice,
That calls me, Lord, to thee;
For cleansing in thy precious blood,
That flow'd on Calvary.

Chorus:
I am coming, Lord!
Coming now to thee!
Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood
That flow'd on Calvary.

2.
Tho' coming weak and vile,
Thou dost my strength assure;
Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,
Till spotless all, and pure. 

Chorus:
I am coming, Lord!
Coming now to thee!
Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood
That flow'd on Calvary.


3.
'Tis Jesus calls me on
To perfect faith and love,
To perfect hope, and peace, and trust,
For earth and heav'n above. 

Chorus:
I am coming, Lord!
Coming now to thee!
Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood
That flow'd on Calvary.


4.
All hail, atoning blood!
All hail, redeeming grace!
All hail!  the gift of Christ, our Lord,
Our Strength and Righteousness. 

Chorus:
I am coming, Lord!
Coming now to thee!
Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood
That flow'd on Calvary.
