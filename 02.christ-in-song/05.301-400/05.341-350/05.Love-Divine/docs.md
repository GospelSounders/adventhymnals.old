## 345. LOVE DIVINE

```txt
1.
Love divine, all love excelling,
Joy of heav'n to earth come down!
Fix in us thy humble dwelling;
All thy faithful mercies crown.
Jesus, thou art all compassion,
Pure, unbounded love thou art;
Visit us with thy salvation;
Enter ev'ry trembling heart.

2.
Breathe, O breathe thy loving Spirit
Into ev'ry troubled breast!
Let us all thy grace inherit,
Let us find thy promised rest.
Take away our bent to sinning;
Alpha and Omega be;
End of faith, as its beginning
Set out hearts at liberty.

3.
Finish then thy new creation;
Pure and spotless let us be;
Let us see thy great salvation
Perfectly restored in thee;
Changed from glory into glory,
Till in heav'n we take our place,
Till we cast our crowns before thee,
Lost in wonder, love, and praise.
