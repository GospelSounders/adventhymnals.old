## 302. NO OTHER NAME

```txt
1.
There's no other name like Jesus,
'Tis the dearest name we know,
'Tis the angels' joy in heaven,
'Tis the Christian's joy below.

Refrain:
Sweet name, dear name,
There's no other name like Jesus;
Sweet name, dear name,
There's no other name like Jesus.

2.
There's no other name like Jesus
When the heart with grief is sad,
There's no other name like Jesus,
When the heart is free and glad. 

Refrain:
Sweet name, dear name,
There's no other name like Jesus;
Sweet name, dear name,
There's no other name like Jesus.


3.
'Tis the hope that I shall see Him,
When in glory He appears,
'Tis the hope to hear His welcome,
That my fainting spirit cheers. 

Refrain:
Sweet name, dear name,
There's no other name like Jesus;
Sweet name, dear name,
There's no other name like Jesus.


4.
If He wills that I should labor
In His vineyard day by day,
Then 'tis well if only Jesus'
Blesses all I do or say. 

Refrain:
Sweet name, dear name,
There's no other name like Jesus;
Sweet name, dear name,
There's no other name like Jesus.


5.
If He wills that death's cold finger
Touch my feeble, mortal clay,
Then 'tis well if only Jesus
Is my dying trust and stay. 

Refrain:
Sweet name, dear name,
There's no other name like Jesus;
Sweet name, dear name,
There's no other name like Jesus.
