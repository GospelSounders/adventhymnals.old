## 321. WE WORSHIP THEE

```txt
1.
O Saviour, precious Saviour,
Whom yet unseen we love,
O Name of might and favor,
All other names above!
We worship Thee, we bless Thee,
To thee, O Christ, we sing;
We praise thee, and confess Thee
Our holy Lord and King.

2.
O bringer of salvation,
Who wondrously hast wrought,
Thyself the revelation 
Of love beyond our tho't,
We worship Thee, we bless Thee,
To Thee, O Christ, we sing;
We praise Thee, and confess Thee
Our gracious Lord and King.

3.
In Thee all fulness dwelleth,
All grace and pow'r divine;
The glory that excelleth,
O Son of God is Thine;
We worship Thee, we bless thee,
To thee, O Christ, we sing;
We praise Thee, and confess Thee
Our glorious Lord and King.

4.
Oh, grant the consummation
Of this our song above,
In endless adoration,
And everlasting love;
Then shall we praise and bless Thee
Where perfect praises ring,
And evermore confess Thee
Our Saviour and our King.
