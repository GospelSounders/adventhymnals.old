## 373. THE SPREADING GOSPEL

```txt
1.
The heav'ns declare Thy glory, Lord,
In ev'ry star Thy wisdom shines,
But viewing Christ within Thy word,
We read Thy love in clearer lines.

2.
The rolling sun, the changing light,
And nights and days, Thy pow'r confess;
But the blest volume Thou didst write,
Reveals Thy justice and Thy grace.

3.
Wide be Thy spreading gospel preached
Till thro' the world Thy truth has run,
Till Christ has all the nations reached,
That see the light, or feel the sun.

4.
Great Sun of Righteousness, arise;
Bless the dark world with heav'nly light:
Thy gospel makes the simple wise,
Thy laws are pure, Thy judgments right.
