## 380. AGAIN THE DAY RETURNS

```txt
1.
Again the day returns of holy rest,
Which, when he made the world, Jehovah blest;
When, like his own, he bade our labor's cease,
And all be piety, and all be peace.

2.
Let us devote this consecrated day
To learn his will, and all we learn obey;
So shall he hear, when fervently we raise
Our supplications, and our songs of praise.

3.
Lord of all worlds, incline thy gracious ear;
Thy children's voice in tender mercy hear;
Bear thy blest promise, fix'd as hills, in mind,
And shed renewing grace on lost mankind.

4.
Father in heav'n, in whom our hopes confide,
Whose pow'r defends us, and whose precepts guide,
Thro' life our surest guardian, and friend,
Glory supreme be thine till time shall end.
