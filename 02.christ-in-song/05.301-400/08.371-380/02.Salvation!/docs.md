## 372. SALVATION!

```txt
1.
Salvation!  O the joyful sound,
'Tis pleasure to our ears,
A sov'reign balm for ev'ry wound,
A cordial for our fears.

2.
Buried in sorrow and in sin,
At hell's dark door we lay;
But we arise, by grace divine,
To see a heav'nly day.

3.
Salvation!  let the echo fly
The spacious earth around,
While all the armies of the sky
Unite to swell the sound.
