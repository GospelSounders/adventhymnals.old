## 368. I'LL PURSUE HIM

```txt
1.
Jesus, my all to heav'n has gone,
He whom I fix my hopes upon;
His track I see, and I'll pursue
The narrow way till him I view.

Refrain:
I'll pursue him, I'll pursue him,
Yes, I'll pursue my Lord and King.

2.
This is the way I long have sought,
And mourned because I found it not;
My brief a burden long has been,
Because I was not saved from sin. 

Refrain:
I'll pursue him, I'll pursue him,
Yes, I'll pursue my Lord and King.


3.
Now will I tell to all around,
What a dear Saviour I have found;
I'll point to thy redeeming blood,
And say, "Behold the way to God." 

Refrain:
I'll pursue him, I'll pursue him,
Yes, I'll pursue my Lord and King.
