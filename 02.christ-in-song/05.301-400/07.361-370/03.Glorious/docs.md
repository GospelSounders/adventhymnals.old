## 363. GLORIOUS

```txt
1.
A glory gilds the sacred page,
Majestic, like the sun;
It gives a light to every age,
It gives, but borrows none.
It gives, but borrows none.

2.
The Spirit breathes upon the word,
And brings the truth to sight;
Precepts and promises afford
A sanctifying light.
A sanctifying light.

3.
The hand that gave it, still supplies
The gracious light and heat;
His truths upon the nations rise,
They rise, but never set.
They rise, but never set.

4.
Let everlasting thanks be thine,
For such a bright display;
It makes a world of darkness shine
With beams of heav'nly day.
With beams of heav'nly day.
