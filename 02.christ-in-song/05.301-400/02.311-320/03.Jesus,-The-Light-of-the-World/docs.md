Hark!  the herald angels sing,
Jesus, the Light of the world;
Glory to the newborn King,
Jesus, the Light of the world.

We'll walk in the light, beautiful light,
Come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright,
Shine all around us by day and by night,
Jesus, the Light of the world.

Joyful, all ye nations rise,
Jesus, the Light of the world;
Join the triumphs of the skies,
Jesus, the Light of the world.

We'll walk in the light, beautiful light,
Come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright,
Shine all around us by day and by night,
Jesus, the Light of the world.

We'll walk in the light, beautiful light,
Come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright,
Shine all around us by day and by night,
Jesus, the Light of the world.

Hail the heav'n born Prince of Peace,
Jesus, the Light of the world;
Hail the sun of righteousness,
Jesus, the Light of the world.

We'll walk in the light, beautiful light,
Come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright,
Shine all around us by day and by night,
Jesus, the Light of the world.
