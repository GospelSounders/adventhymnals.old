## 817. OUR EXILED FATHERS

```txt
1.
O God, beneath thy guiding hand,
Our exiled fathers cross the sea;
And when they trod the wintry strand,
With pray'r and psalm they worshiped thee.

2.
Truth, freedom, justice, faith in God,
Came with those exiles o'er the waves;
And where their pilgrim feet have trod,
The God they trusted guards their graves.

3.
And here thy name, O God of love,
May we, their children, still adorn,
Till these eternal hills remove,
And spring adorns the earth no more.
```
