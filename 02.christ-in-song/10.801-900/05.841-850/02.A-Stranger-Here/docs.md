## 842. A STRANGER HERE

```txt
1.
I'm but a stranger here,
Heav'n is my home;
Earth is a desert drear,
Heav'n is my home;
Danger and sorrow stand 
Round me on ev'ry hand,
Heav'n is my Fatherland,
Heav'n is my home.

2.
What though the tempest rage,
Heaven is my home;
Short is my pilgrimage,
Heaven is my home.
Time's cold and wintry blast
Soon will be overpast;
I shall reach home at last;
Heaven is my home.

3.
There at my Saviour's side,
Heaven is my home,
I shall be glorified,
Heaven is my home.
There'll be the good and blest,
Those I love most and best;
There, too, I soon shall rest;
Heaven is my home.
```
