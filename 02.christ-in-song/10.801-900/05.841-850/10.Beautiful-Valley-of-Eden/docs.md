## 850. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY OF EDEN

```txt
1.
Beautiful valley of Eden, 
Sweet is thy noon-tide calm;
Over the hearts of the weary,
Breathing thy waves of balm.

2.
Over the heart of the mourner
Shineth the golden day,
Wafting the songs of the angels
Down from the far away. 

null


3.
There is the home of my Saviour
There with the blood-washed throng;
Over the highland of glory
Rolleth the great new song.
