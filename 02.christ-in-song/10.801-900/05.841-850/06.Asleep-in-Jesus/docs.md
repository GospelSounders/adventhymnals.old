## 846. ASLEEP IN JESUS

```txt
1.
Asleep in Jesus!  blessed sleep
From which none ever wake to weep;
A calm and undisturbed repose,
Unbroken by the last of foes.

2.
Asleep in Jesus!  O how sweet
To be for such a slumber meet!
With holy confidence to rest
In hope of being ever blest.

3.
Asleep in Jesus!  Peaceful rest,
Whose waking is supremely blest;
No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour
That manifests the Saviour's pow'r.

4.
Asleep in Jesus!  Soon to rise,
When the last trump shall read the skies;
Then burst the fetters of the tomb,
And wake in full, immortal bloom.
