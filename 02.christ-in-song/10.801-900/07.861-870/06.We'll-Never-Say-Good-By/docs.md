## 866. WE'LL NEVER SAY GOOD-BY

```txt
1.
With friends on earth we meet in gladness,
While swift the moments fly,
Yet ever comes the tho't of sadness,
That we must say "Good-by."

Chorus:
We'll never say good-by in heav'n,
We'll never say good-by,
In that fair land of joy and song
We'll never say good-by.

2.
How joyful is the hope that lingers,
When loved ones say "Farewell,"
That we, when all earth's toils are ended,
With them shall ever dwell. 

Chorus:
We'll never say good-by in heav'n,
We'll never say good-by,
In that fair land of joy and song
We'll never say good-by.


3.
No parting words shall e'er be spoken
In yonder home so fair;
But songs of joy, and peace, and gladness,
We'll sing forever there. 

Chorus:
We'll never say good-by in heav'n,
We'll never say good-by,
In that fair land of joy and song
We'll never say good-by.
