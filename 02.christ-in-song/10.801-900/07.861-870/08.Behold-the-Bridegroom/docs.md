Are you ready for the Bridegroom
When he comes, when he comes?
Behold, he cometh!  behold, he cometh!
Be robed and ready; for the Bridegroom comes.

Chorus:
Behold the Bridegroom; for he comes, for he comes!
Behold the Bridegroom; for he comes, for he comes.
Behold, he cometh!  behold, he cometh!
Be robed and ready, for the Bridegroom comes.

Have your lamps trimm'd and burning
When he comes, when he comes:
Have your lamps trimm'd and burning 
When he comes, when he comes;
He quickly cometh!  he quickly cometh!
O soul, be ready when the Bridegroom comes. 

Chorus:
Behold the Bridegroom; for he comes, for he comes!
Behold the Bridegroom; for he comes, for he comes.
Behold, he cometh!  behold, he cometh!
Be robed and ready, for the Bridegroom comes.

We will all go out to meet him
When he comes, when he comes;
We will all go out to meet him
When he comes, when he comes;
He surely cometh!  he surely cometh!
We'll go to meet him when the Bridegroom comes. 

Chorus:
Behold the Bridegroom; for he comes, for he comes!
Behold the Bridegroom; for he comes, for he comes.
Behold, he cometh!  behold, he cometh!
Be robed and ready, for the Bridegroom comes.

We will chant alleluias
When he comes, when he comes;
We will chant alleluias
When he comes, when he comes;
Lo!  now he cometh!  lo! now he cometh!
Sing alleluia! for the Bridegroom comes. 

Chorus:
Behold the Bridegroom; for he comes, for he comes!
Behold the Bridegroom; for he comes, for he comes.
Behold, he cometh!  behold, he cometh!
Be robed and ready, for the Bridegroom comes.
