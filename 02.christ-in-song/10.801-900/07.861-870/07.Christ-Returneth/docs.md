## 867. CHRIST RETURNETH

```txt
1.
It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,
When sunlight thro' darkness and shadow is breaking,
That Jesus will come in the fullness of glory
To receive from the world His own.

Chorus:
O Lord Jesus, how long, how long
Ere we shout the glad song?
Christ returneth, Hallelujah!  hallelujah! 
Amen, Hallelujah!  Amen.

2.
It may be at midday, and it may be at twilight,
It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight
Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,
When Jesus receives His own. 

Chorus:
O Lord Jesus, how long, how long
Ere we shout the glad song?
Christ returneth, Hallelujah!  hallelujah! 
Amen, Hallelujah!  Amen.


3.
While His hosts cry Hosanna, from heaven, descending,
With glorified saints and the angels attending,
With grace on His brow, like a halo of glory;
Will Jesus receive "His own." 

Chorus:
O Lord Jesus, how long, how long
Ere we shout the glad song?
Christ returneth, Hallelujah!  hallelujah! 
Amen, Hallelujah!  Amen.


4.
O joy!  O delight!  should we go without dying,
No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and no crying,
Caught up thro' the clouds with our Lord into glory,
When Jesus receives His own. 

Chorus:
O Lord Jesus, how long, how long
Ere we shout the glad song?
Christ returneth, Hallelujah!  hallelujah! 
Amen, Hallelujah!  Amen.
