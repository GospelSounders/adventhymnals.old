## 831. REST IN THEE

```txt
1.
Come, thou long-expected Jesus,
Born to set Thy people free:
From our fears and sins release us,
Let us find our rest in Thee.

2.
Born Thy people to deliver,
Born a child, and yet a King;
Born to reign in us forever,
Now Thy gracious Kingdom bring.

3.
By Thine own eternal Spirit,
Rule in all our hearts alone;
By Thine all-sufficient merit,
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.

```
