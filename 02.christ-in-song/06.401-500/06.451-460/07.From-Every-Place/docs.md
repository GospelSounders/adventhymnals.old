## 457. FROM EVERY PLACE

```txt
1.
O thou to whom, in ancient time,
The psalmist's sacred harp was strung,
Whom kings adored in songs sublime,
And prophets praised with glowing tongue,

2.
From ev'ry place below the skies,
The grateful song, the fervent prayer
The incense of the heart may rise
To heav'n, and find acceptance there.

3.
To thee shall age, with snowy hair,
And strength, and beauty, bend the knee,
And childhood lisp with rev'rent air
Its praises and its prayers to thee.
```
