## 456. HOW PLEASANT

```txt
1.
How pleasant, how divinely fair,
O Lord of hosts, thy dwellings are!
With long desire my spirit faints
To meet th' assemblies of the saints.

2.
Blest are the souls that find a place
Within the temple of thy grace;
There they behold thy gentle rays,
And seek thy face and learn thy praise.

3.
Blest are the men whose hearts are set
To find the way to Zion's gate;
God is their strength; and thro' the road
They lean upon their helper, God.
