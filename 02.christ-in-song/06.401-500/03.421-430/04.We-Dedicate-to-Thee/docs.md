## 424. WE DEDICATE TO THEE

```txt
1.
Maker of land and rolling sea,
We dedicate this house to thee;
And what our willing hands have done,
We give to God and to the Son.

2.
Come, fill this house with heav'nly grace,
While sinners throng the sacred place,
And saints, with angel hosts above,
Unite to sing redeeming love.

3.
Here, let the mourning soul find rest
Upon the loving Saviour's breast;
And with the sense of sins forgiv'n,
Each heart aspire to God and heav'n.
