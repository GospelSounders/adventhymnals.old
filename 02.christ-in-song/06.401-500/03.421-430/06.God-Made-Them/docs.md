## 426. GOD MADE THEM

```txt
1.
Each little flow'r that opens,
Each little bird that sings;
God made their glowing colors,
He made their tiny wings;

2.
The purple-headed mountain,
The river running by,
The sunset and the morning,
That brighten up the sky;

3.
The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
God made them ev'ry one.

4.
He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well.
