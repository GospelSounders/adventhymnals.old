## 474. SAVED TO SERVE

```txt
1.
Saved to serve in any station,
Saved to make his goodness known;
Saved to sing His great salvation,
Saved to live for Him alone.

Chorus:
Saved to serve; no reserve;
Saved to wear His yoke alone;
Work and praise, all my days,
Here and round His glorious throne.

2.
Saved to show by loving kindness
That His love is full and free;
Saved to lead from error's blindness
With a tender sympathy. 

Chorus:
Saved to serve; no reserve;
Saved to wear His yoke alone;
Work and praise, all my days,
Here and round His glorious throne.


3.
Saved to lift my lowest brothers,
As the Highest lifted me;
Crucified with Him, that others
May have immortality. 

Chorus:
Saved to serve; no reserve;
Saved to wear His yoke alone;
Work and praise, all my days,
Here and round His glorious throne.
