## 471. THANKS AT MEALS

```txt
1.
Be present at our table, Lord,
Be here and ev'rywhere adored;
These mercies bless, and grant that we
May feast in Paradise with Thee.

2.
We thank Thee, Lord, for this our food,
For life, and health, and ev'ry good:
Let manna to our souls be giv'n,
The Bread of Life sent down from heav'n.
```
