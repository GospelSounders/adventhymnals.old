## 435. CALM MY MIND

```txt
1.
Come, Holy Spirit, calm my mind,
And fit me to approach my God;
Remove each vain, each worldly tho't,
And lead me to thy blest abode.

2.
Hast thou imparted to my soul
A living spark of holy fire?
O, kindle now the sacred flame;
Make me to burn with pure desire.

3.
A brighter faith and hope impart,
And let me now my Saviour see;
O, soothe and cheer my burdened heart,
And bid my spirit rest in thee.
```
