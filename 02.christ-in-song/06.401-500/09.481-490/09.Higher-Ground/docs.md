## 489. HIGHER GROUND

```txt
1.
I'm pressing on the upward way,
New heights I'm gaining ev'ry day;
Still praying as I onward bound,
"Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."

Chorus:
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith on heaven's tableland,
A higher plane than I have found; 
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

2.
My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Tho' some may dwell where these abound,
My prayer, my aim is higher ground. 

Chorus:
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith on heaven's tableland,
A higher plane than I have found; 
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.


3.
I want to live above the world,
Tho' Satan's darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joyful sound, 
The song of saints on higher ground. 

Chorus:
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith on heaven's tableland,
A higher plane than I have found; 
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.


4.
I want to scale the utmost height,
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I'll pray till heav'n I've found,
"Lord, lead me on to higher ground." 

Chorus:
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith on heaven's tableland,
A higher plane than I have found; 
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
