## 461. HIS EXAMPLE

```txt
1.
This rite our blest Redeemer gave
To all in him believing;
He bids us seek this hallowed grave,
To his example cleaving.

Chorus:
I'll follow now my glorious Lord,
Whate'er the ties I sever;
He saves my soul, he's left his word
To guide me now and ever.

2.
For me the cross and shame to bear,
Dear Saviour, thou wast willing;
Nor would I shrink thy yoke to wear,
All righteousness fulfilling. 

Chorus:
I'll follow now my glorious Lord,
Whate'er the ties I sever;
He saves my soul, he's left his word
To guide me now and ever.


3.
Jesus to thee we yield our all;
In thy kind arms enfold us;
Our hearts are fixed, no fears appall,
Thy gracious power shall hold us. 

Chorus:
I'll follow now my glorious Lord,
Whate'er the ties I sever;
He saves my soul, he's left his word
To guide me now and ever.
