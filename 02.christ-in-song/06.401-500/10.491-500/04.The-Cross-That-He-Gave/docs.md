## 494. THE CROSS THAT HE GAVE

```txt
1.
The cross that he gave may be heavy,
But it ne'er outweighs His grace;
The storm that I fear may surround me,
But it ne'er excludes His face.

Chorus:
The cross is not greater than His grace,
The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
I am satisfied to know
That with Jesus here below,
I can conquer ev'ry foe.

2.
The thorns in my path are not sharper
Than composed his crown for me;
The cup that I drink not more bitter
Than he drank in Gethsemane. 

Chorus:
The cross is not greater than His grace,
The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
I am satisfied to know
That with Jesus here below,
I can conquer ev'ry foe.


3.
The light of his love shineth brighter,
As it falls on paths of woe;
The toil of my work groweth lighter,
As I stoop to raise the low. 

Chorus:
The cross is not greater than His grace,
The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
I am satisfied to know
That with Jesus here below,
I can conquer ev'ry foe.


4.
His will I have joy in fulfilling,
As I'm walking in his sight;
My all to the blood I am bringing,
It alone can keep me right. 

Chorus:
The cross is not greater than His grace,
The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
I am satisfied to know
That with Jesus here below,
I can conquer ev'ry foe.
