## 414. WITH WILLING HEARTS

```txt
1.
With willing hearts we tread
The path our Saviour trod;
We love th' example of our Head,
The glorious Lamb of God.

2.
On thee, on thee alone,
Our hope and faith rely,
O thou who wilt for sin atone,
Who didst for sinners died.

3.
We trust thy sacrifice,
To thy dear cross we flee;
O may we die to sin, and rise
To life and bliss in thee.
```
