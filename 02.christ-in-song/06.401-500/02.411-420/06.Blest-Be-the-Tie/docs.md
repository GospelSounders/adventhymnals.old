## 416. BLEST BE THE TIE

```txt
1.
Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love!
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

2.
Before our Father's throne
We pour our ardent pray'rs;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

3.
We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

4.
When we asunder part,
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart
And hope to meet again.

```
