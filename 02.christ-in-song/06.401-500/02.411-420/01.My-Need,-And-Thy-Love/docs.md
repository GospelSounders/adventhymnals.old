## 411. MY NEED, AND THY LOVE

```txt
1.
O Father, I have naught to plead
In earth beneath or heav'n above,
But just my own exceeding need,
And thy exceeding love.

2.
The need will soon be past and gone,
Exceeding great, but quickly o'er;
Thy love unbought is all thine own,
And lasts forevermore.

```
