## 409. I WILL FOLLOW THEE

```txt
1.
I will follow thee, my Saviour,
Wheresoe'er my lot may be;
Where thou goest I will follow;
Yes, my Lord, I'll follow thee.

Chorus:
I will follow thee, my Saviour,
Thou didst shed thy blood for me;
And tho' all men should forsake thee,
By thy grace I'll follow thee.

2.
Tho' the road be rough and thorny,
Trackless as the foaming sea,
Thou hast trod this way before me,
And I'll gladly follow thee.
[Chorus]

3.
Tho' I meet with tribulations,
Surely tempted tho' I be;
I remember thou wast tempted
And rejoice to follow thee. 

Chorus:
I will follow thee, my Saviour,
Thou didst shed thy blood for me;
And tho' all men should forsake thee,
By thy grace I'll follow thee.


4.
Though thou lead'st me thro' affliction,
Poor, forsaken, though I be;
Thou wast destitute, afflicted,
And I only follow thee. 

Chorus:
I will follow thee, my Saviour,
Thou didst shed thy blood for me;
And tho' all men should forsake thee,
By thy grace I'll follow thee.


5.
Though to Jordan's rolling billows,
Cold and deep, thou leadest me,
Thou hast crossed the waves before me,
And I still will follow thee. 

Chorus:
I will follow thee, my Saviour,
Thou didst shed thy blood for me;
And tho' all men should forsake thee,
By thy grace I'll follow thee.
