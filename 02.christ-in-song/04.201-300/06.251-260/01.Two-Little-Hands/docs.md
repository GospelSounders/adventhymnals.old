## 251. TWO LITTLE HANDS

```txt
1.
I've two little hands to work for Jesus,
One little tongue his praise to tell,
Two little ears to hear his counsel,
One little voice a song to swell.

Chorus:
Lord, we come, Lord, we come,
In our childhood's early morning,
Lord, we come, Lord, we come,
Come to learn of thee.

2.
I've two little feet to tread the pathway
Up to the heav'nly courts above;
Two little eyes to read the Bible,
Telling of Jesus' wondrous love. 

Chorus:
Lord, we come, Lord, we come,
In our childhood's early morning,
Lord, we come, Lord, we come,
Come to learn of thee.


3.
I've one little heart to give to Jesus,
One little soul for him to save,
One little life for his dear service,
One little self that he must have. 

Chorus:
Lord, we come, Lord, we come,
In our childhood's early morning,
Lord, we come, Lord, we come,
Come to learn of thee.
