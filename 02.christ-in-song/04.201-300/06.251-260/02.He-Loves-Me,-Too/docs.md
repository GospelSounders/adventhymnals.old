## 252. HE LOVES ME, TOO

```txt
1.
God sees the little sparrow fall
It meets his tender view;
If God so loves the little birds,
I know he loves me, too.

Chorus:
He loves me, too, he loves me, too,
I know he loves me, too;
Because he loves the little things, 
I know he loves me, too.

2.
He paints the lily of the field,
Perfumes each lily bell;
If he so loves the little flow'rs,
I know he loves me well. 

Chorus:
He loves me, too, he loves me, too,
I know he loves me, too;
Because he loves the little things, 
I know he loves me, too.


3.
God made the little birds and flowr's,
And all things large and small;
He'll not forget his little ones,
I know he loves them all. 

Chorus:
He loves me, too, he loves me, too,
I know he loves me, too;
Because he loves the little things, 
I know he loves me, too.
