## 232. SINGING ALL THE TIME

```txt
1.
I feel like singing all the time,
My tears are wiped away;
For Jesus is a friend of mine,
I'll serve him ev'ry day.

Chorus:
I'm singing, singing,
Singing all the time;
Singing, singing, 
singing all the time.

2.
When on the cross my Lord I saw,
Nail'd there by sins of mine;
Fast fell the burning tears; 
but now I'm singing all the time. 

Chorus:
I'm singing, singing,
Singing all the time;
Singing, singing, 
singing all the time.


3.
When fierce temptations try my heart,
I sing, Jesus is mine;
And tho; the tears at times may start,
I'm singing all the time. 

Chorus:
I'm singing, singing,
Singing all the time;
Singing, singing, 
singing all the time.


4.
The wondrous story of the Lamb,
Tell with that voice of thine;
Till others with the glad new song,
Go singing all the time.  [Chorus] 
```
