## 272. ON TIME

```txt
1.
List to the chime, 'tis meeting time,
The joyous bells are ringing;
This is the day, they seem to say,
To meet for pray'r and singing.

Chorus:
Ring, ring, ring, ring,
Ring, ye joyous bells;
Ring, ring, ring, ring,
Ring, ye joyous bells.

2.
Join with the throng and swell the song,
The Saviour's love confessing;
Offer a pray'r that you may share
The fulness of His blessing.

Chorus:
Ring, ring, ring, ring, 
Ring, ye joyous bells;
Ring, ring, ring, ring, 
Ring, ye joyous bells.

3.
Learn of the way, and then obey
The truth so kindly given;
Thus, may you say, each closing day;
I'm nearer home and heaven.

Chorus:
On time, on time,
Answer to the chime;
On time, on time,
Always here on time.
