## 207. THERE SHALL BE SHOWERS OF BLESSING

```txt
1.
"There shall be showers of blessing:"
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Saviour above.

Chorus:
Showers, showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.

2.
"There shall be showers of blessing"
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain. 

Chorus:
Showers, showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.


3.
"There shall be showers of blessing:"
Send them upon us, O Lord;
Grant to us now a refreshing,
Come, and now honor Thy Word. 

Chorus:
Showers, showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.


4.
"There shall be showers of blessing;"
Oh, that today they might fall,
Now as to God we're confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call! 

Chorus:
Showers, showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.
