## 214. AWAKE MY SOUL

```txt
1.
Awake, my soul, and greet the dawn,
Behold, the dreary night is gone;
The sunless grave gives back its prey,
For Christ came forth at break of day.

Chorus:
Awake, my soul,
The Saviour lives, no more to die,
Awake, my soul, 
The Lord ascends on high.

2.
Amazed were they, the Roman guard,
Who fast the sepulcher had barred,
To see how vain the watch the seal,
When Jesus did his might reveal. 

Chorus:
Awake, my soul,
The Saviour lives, no more to die,
Awake, my soul, 
The Lord ascends on high.


3.
In lofty strains let Zion sing
The praise of her triumphant King;
Captivity is captive led,
For Christ is risen from the dead. 

Chorus:
Awake, my soul,
The Saviour lives, no more to die,
Awake, my soul, 
The Lord ascends on high.
