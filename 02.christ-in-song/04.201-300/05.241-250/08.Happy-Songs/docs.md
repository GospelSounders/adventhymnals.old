## 248. HAPPY SONGS

```txt
1.
Long ago the children sang a song
Of praise to Jesus as he rode along:
"Hosanna!  Hosanna!  
Hosanna in the highest!"

Chorus:
Happy songs, happy songs,
Let the children sing their happy, happy songs;
Happy songs, happy songs,
Jesus loves to hear our songs.

2.
As of old he loves to hear us sing
Our songs of praise to him, our heav'nly King:
"Hosanna!  Hosanna!  
Hosanna in the highest!' 

Chorus:
Happy songs, happy songs,
Let the children sing their happy, happy songs;
Happy songs, happy songs,
Jesus loves to hear our songs.


3.
By and by we'll sing a sweeter song
With all the saved, a glad and glorious throng:
"Hosanna!  Hosanna!
Hosanna in the highest!" 

Chorus:
Happy songs, happy songs,
Let the children sing their happy, happy songs;
Happy songs, happy songs,
Jesus loves to hear our songs.
