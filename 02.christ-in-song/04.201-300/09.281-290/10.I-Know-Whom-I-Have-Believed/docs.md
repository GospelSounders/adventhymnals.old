## 290. I KNOW WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED

```txt
1.
Since on my Saviour I believed,
His beams around me shine;
The Spirit's witness I received,
I know that He is mine.

Chorus:
"I know whom I have believed,
and am persuaded that He is able
To keep what I have committed
unto Him against that day."

2.
I know His love, His faithful care;
His mighty saving pow'r;
His willingness to answer pray'r,
His grace in sun and show'r. 

Chorus:
"I know whom I have believed,
and am persuaded that He is able
To keep what I have committed
unto Him against that day."


3.
In His dear wounded hands I leave
All that concerneth me;
The flow'rs that please, the thorns that grieve,
Shall fraught with blessing be. 

Chorus:
"I know whom I have believed,
and am persuaded that He is able
To keep what I have committed
unto Him against that day."


4.
Tho' all things else should pass away,
He changeless, would remain.
So will I sing, till dawns His day,
Faith's jubilant refrain. 

Chorus:
"I know whom I have believed,
and am persuaded that He is able
To keep what I have committed
unto Him against that day."
