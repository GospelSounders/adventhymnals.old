## 764. THE SACRED BOOK

```txt
1.
I love the sacred book of God,
No other can its place supply;
It points me to the saints' abode,
And bids me from destruction fly.

2.
Sweet book!  in thee my eyes discern
The image of my absent Lord;
From thy instructive page I learn
The joys his presence will afford.

3.
But while I'm here, thou shalt supply 
His place, and tell me of his love; 
I'll read with faith's discerning eye,
And thus partake of joys above.

```
