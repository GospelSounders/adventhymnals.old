## 711. REVIVE THY WORK

```txt
1.
Revive Thy work, O Lord, Thy mighty arm make bare;
Speak with the voice that wakes the dead, and make Thy people hear.

2.
Revive Thy work, O Lord, disturb this sleep of death;
Quicken the smould'ring embers now by Thine almighty breath.

3.
Revive Thy work, O Lord, create soul-thirst for Thee;
And hung'ring for the bread of life, oh, may our spirits be.

4.
Revive Thy work, O Lord, exalt Thy precious name;
And by the Holy Ghost our love for Thee and Thine inflame.
