## 743. BLESSED HOPE

```txt
1.
There is a blessed hope,
More precious and more bright
Than all the joyless mockery
The world esteems delight.

2.
There is a lovely star
That lights the darkest gloom,
And sheds a peaceful radiance o'er
The prospects of the tomb.

3.
There is a cheering voice
That lifts the soul above,
Dispels the painful, anxious doubt,
And whispers, "God is love."

4.
That voice from Calv'ry's height
Proclaims the soul forgiv'n;
That star is revelation's light,
That hope, the hope of heav'n.
