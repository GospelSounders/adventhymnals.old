## 749. SWEET THE TIME

```txt
1.
Sweet the time, exceeding sweet!
When the saints together meet
When the Saviour is the theme,
When they join to sing of him.

2.
Sing we then eternal love,
Such as did the Father move
He beheld the world undone,
Loved the world the gave his Son.

3.
Sing the Son's amazing love;
How he left the realms above,
Took our nature and our place,
Lived and died to save our race.

4.
Sweet the time, exceeding sweet,
When the saints in heav'n shall meet
Jesus still will be the theme,
They shall always sing of him.
