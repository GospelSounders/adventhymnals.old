## 748. SCORN PRAISE OF MEN

```txt
1.
O blest is he who can divine
Where truth and justice lie,
And dares to take the side that seems
Wrong to man's blinded eye.

2.
Then learn to scorn the praise of men,
And learn to lose with God;
For Jesus won the world thro' shame,
And beckons thee his road.

3.
For right is right, since God is God,
And right the day must win;
To doubt would be disloyalty,
To falter would be sin.
