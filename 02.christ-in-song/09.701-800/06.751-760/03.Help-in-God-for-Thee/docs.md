## 753. HELP IN GOD FOR THEE

```txt
1.
The tempter to my soul hath said, 
"There is no help in God for thee;"
Lord, lift thou up thy servant's head;
My glory, shield, and solace be.

2.
Thus to the Lord I raised my cry;
He heard me from his holy hill;
At his command the waves rolled by;
He beckoned, and the winds were still.

3.
I will not fear, tho' armed throngs
Compass my steps in all their wrath;
Salvation to the Lord belongs;
His presence guards his people's path.
