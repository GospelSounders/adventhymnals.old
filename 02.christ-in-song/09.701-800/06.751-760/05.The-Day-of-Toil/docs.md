## 755. THE DAY OF TOIL

```txt
1.
This is the day of toil
Beneath earth's sultry noon;
This is the day of service true,
But resting cometh soon.

2.
Spend and be spent would we,
While lasteth time's brief day;
No turning back in coward fear,
No ling'ring by the way.

3.
Onward we press in haste,
Upward our journey still;
Ours is the path the Master trod
Thro' good report and ill.

4.
The way may rougher grow,
The weariness increase,
We gird our loins and hasten on,
The end, the end is peace.
