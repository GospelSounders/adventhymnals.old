## 774. THE DAY IS PAST

```txt
1.
The day is past and gone,
The evening shades appear;
O, may we all remember well
The night of death draws near.

2.
Lord, keep us safe this night,
Secure from all our fears;
May angels guard us while we sleep,
Till morning light appears.

3.
When all our days are past,
And we from time remove,
O, may we in thy bosom rest
The bosom of thy love.
