## 791. A SOLDIER OF THE CROSS

```txt
1.
Am I a soldier of the cross,
A foll'wer of the Lamb?
And shall I fear to own his cause,
Or blush to speak his name?
Or blush to speak his name?

2.
Must I be carried to the skies
On flow'ry beds of ease,
Whilst others fought to win the prize,
And sailed thro' bloody seas?
And sailed thro' bloody seas?

3.
Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend of grace,
To help me on to God?
To help me on to God?

4.
 Sure I must fight if I would reign;
Increase my courage, Lord;
I'll hear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by thy word,
Supported by thy word.
