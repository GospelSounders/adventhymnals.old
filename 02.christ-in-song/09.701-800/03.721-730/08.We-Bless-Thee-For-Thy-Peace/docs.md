## 728. WE BLESS THEE FOR THY PEACE

```txt
1.
We bless Thee for Thy peace, O God,
Deep as th' unfathomed sea,
Which falls like sunshine on the road
Of those who trust in Thee.

2.
We ask not, Father, for repose
Which comes from outward rest,
If we may have thro' all life's woes
Thy peace within our breast,

3.
That peace which suffers and is strong
Trusts where it cannot see,
Deems not the trial way too long,
But leaves the end with Thee.

4.
That peace which flows serene and deep
A river in the soul
Whose banks a living verdure keep,
God's sunshine o'er the whole.

5.
O Father, give our hearts this peace,
Whate'er the outward be,
Till all life's discipline shall cease,
And we go home to Thee.
