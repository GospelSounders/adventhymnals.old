## 727. THE LIVING CHURCH

```txt
1.
Oh, where are kings and empires now,
Of old that went and came?
But, Lord, Thy Church is living yet,
Thro' ages still the same.

2.
We mark her goodly battlements,
And her foundations strong;
We hear within the solemn voice
Of her unending song.

3.
For not like kingdoms of the world
Thy holy church, O God!
They change with changing words of men;
She rests upon Thy word.

4.
Unshaken as eternal hills,
When on Thy truth she stands,
A mountain that shall fill the earth,
A house not made by hands.
