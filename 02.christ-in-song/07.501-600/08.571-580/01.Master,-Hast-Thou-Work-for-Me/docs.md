## 571. MASTER, HAST THOU WORK FOR ME

```txt
1.
Master, hast thou work for me?
I would gladly toil for thee;
I have neither strength nor skill,
Yet some place I long to fill;

Refrain:
Tho' my hands are small and weak,
Yet some little task I seek.
Master, hast thou work for me?
I would gladly toil for thee.

2.
Let me learn in early youth,
Lessons from thy Book of truth;
Let me seek to walk thy ways,
Know thy will and sing thy praise;  

Refrain: 
Heart and hands to thee I bring,
Let me serve thee, holy King!
Master, hast thou work for me?  
I would gladly toil for thee.

3.
Let me daily sow some seed,
Daily do some kindly deed;
Grant thy loving help to me,
Give me perfect trust in thee;

Refrain:
Trusting thee to teach me how,
Let me serve thee, here and now.
Master, hast thou work for me?
I would gladly toil for thee.
