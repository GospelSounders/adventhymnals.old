## 574. TOILING FOR JESUS

```txt
1.
Gladly, gladly, toiling for the Master,
Go we forth with willing hands to do
Whatsoe'er to us he hath appointed,
Faithfully our mission we'll pursue.

Refrain:
Toiling for Jesus,
Joyfully we go, joyfully we go
Toiling for Jesus,
In his vineyard here below.

2.
Joyful, joyful, we will tell the story
Of his love to mortals here below;
Christ, the brightness of the Father's glory,
Freely here his blessing will bestow. 

Refrain:
Toiling for Jesus,
Joyfully we go, joyfully we go
Toiling for Jesus,
In his vineyard here below.


3.
Meekly, meekly, following the Master,
Walking faithfully the path he trod;
Leading wand'rers to the dear Redeemer,
Pointing sinners to the Lamb of God. 

Refrain:
Toiling for Jesus,
Joyfully we go, joyfully we go
Toiling for Jesus,
In his vineyard here below.
