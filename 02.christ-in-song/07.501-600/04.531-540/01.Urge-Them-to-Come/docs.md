## 531. URGE THEM TO COME

```txt
1.
In the highways and hedges go seek for the lost,
Gather them in to the fold,
Was the earnest command that our Saviour divine
Taught his disciples of old.

Chorus:
Urge them to come, show them the way;
Tenderly, lovingly, bring them today;
Urge them to come, why should they roam?
Bring them along to our dear Saviour's home.

2.
If the Shepherd we love, we will care for the sheep;
Precious are they in his sight;
They are out in the desert, they wander alone;
Lead them from darkness to light. 

Chorus:
Urge them to come, show them the way;
Tenderly, lovingly, bring them today;
Urge them to come, why should they roam?
Bring them along to our dear Saviour's home.


3.
To the weary and thirsty the Saviour has said,
"Come, heavy laden, to me,
I will give you to drink of the water of life;"
Tell them the fountain is free. 

Chorus:
Urge them to come, show them the way;
Tenderly, lovingly, bring them today;
Urge them to come, why should they roam?
Bring them along to our dear Saviour's home.


4.
There's welcome for all in the kingdom of grace,
All who repent and believe;
And the souls that have stray'd and returned to the fold,
Jesus will gladly receive. 

Chorus:
Urge them to come, show them the way;
Tenderly, lovingly, bring them today;
Urge them to come, why should they roam?
Bring them along to our dear Saviour's home.
