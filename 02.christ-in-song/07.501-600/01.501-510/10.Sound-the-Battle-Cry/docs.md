## 510. SOUND THE BATTLE CRY

```txt
1.
Sound the battle cry, 
See!  the foe is nigh;
Raise the standard high  
For the Lord;
Gird your armor on, 
Stand firm, ev'ry one,
Rest your cause upon 
His holy word.

Chorus:
Rouse, then soldiers!  rally round the banner!
Ready, steady, pass the word along;
Onward, forward, shout a loud Hosanna!
Christ is Captain of the faithful throng.

2.
Strong to meet the foe, 
Marching on we go,
While our cause we know  
Must prevail;
Shield and banner bright, 
Gleaming in the light,
Battling for the right, 
We ne'er can fail. 

Chorus:
Rouse, then soldiers!  rally round the banner!
Ready, steady, pass the word along;
Onward, forward, shout a loud Hosanna!
Christ is Captain of the faithful throng.


3.
O thou God of all, 
Hear us when we call, 
Help us, one and all, 
By thy grace;
When the battle's done,
And the vict'ry won,
May we wear the crown  
Before thy face. 

Chorus:
Rouse, then soldiers!  rally round the banner!
Ready, steady, pass the word along;
Onward, forward, shout a loud Hosanna!
Christ is Captain of the faithful throng.
