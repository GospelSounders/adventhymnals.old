## 569. LITTLE FEET, BE CAREFUL

```txt
1.
I wash'd my hands this morning,
O very clean and white,
And lent them both to Jesus,
To work for him till night.

Chorus:
Little feet, be careful,
Where you take me to,
Anything for Jesus,
Only let me do.

2.
I told my ears to listen
Quite closely all day thro',
For any act of kindness,
Such little hands can do. 

Chorus:
Little feet, be careful,
Where you take me to,
Anything for Jesus,
Only let me do.


3.
My eyes are set to watch them
About their work or play,
To keep them out of mischief,
For Jesus' sake all day. 

Chorus:
Little feet, be careful,
Where you take me to,
Anything for Jesus,
Only let me do.
