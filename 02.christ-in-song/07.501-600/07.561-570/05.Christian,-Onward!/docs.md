## 565. CHRISTIAN, ONWARD!

```txt
1.
Christian, onward!  Christ is coming,
Wake the hour of jubilee;
Nations waiting for the message
Onward, Christian, victory!
Hell's proud cohorts almost vanquished,
Vanquished for eternity.

2.
Hear the cry of distant nations,
Hear the call to you and me:
Come and lift the fallen sinner,
Help from Satan's wrath to flee.
Christian, onward!  Christ is coming,
Wake the hour of jubilee.

3.
Then with strength and courage ever,
Gird the gospel armor on;
Faithfully we'll press the battle
Till the victory is won.
Christian, onward!  Christ is coming,
Wake the hour of jubilee.

4.
Onward, onward, ever onward,
Be our watchword in the fray,
Bear the banner bravely forward,
Let there be no more delay.
Christian, onward!  Christ is coming,
Wake the hour of jubilee.
