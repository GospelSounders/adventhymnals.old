## 563. JUST FOR TO-DAY

```txt
1.
Lord, for tomorrow and its needs,
I do not pray;
Keep me from ev'ry stain of sin
Just for today;
Let me no wrong or idle word
Unthinking say;
Set Thou a seal upon my lips,
Just for to-day.

2.
I would both diligently work
And duly pray;
I would be kind in word and deed
Just for to-day;
O make me strong to do Thy will,
Swift to obey,
Willing to sacrifice myself,
Just for to-day.  

3.
And if to-day this life of mine
Should ebb away,
O may Thy promises divine,
Still be my stay.
So for tomorrow and its needs I do not pray;
O keep me, guide me, hold me, Lord,
Just for to-day.  Amen.
```
