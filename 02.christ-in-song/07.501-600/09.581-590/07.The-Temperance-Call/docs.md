## 587. THE TEMPERANCE CALL

```txt
1.
Hear the temp'rance call,
Freemen one and all,
Hear your country's  earnest cry;
See your native land
Life her beck'ning hand;
Sons of freedom, come ye nigh.

Chorus:
Starve the monster from our shore,
Let his cruel reign be o'er;
Starve the monster from our shore,
Let his cruel reign be o'er.

2.
Leave the shop and farm,
Leave your bright hearths warm;
Work and pray the lost to save;
Let your leaders be 
True and noble, free,
Fearless, temp'rate, good, and grave. 

Chorus:
Starve the monster from our shore,
Let his cruel reign be o'er;
Starve the monster from our shore,
Let his cruel reign be o'er.


3.
Hail!  our Fatherland,
Here thy children stand,
All resolv'd, united, true;
In the temp'rance cause 
Ne'er to faint or pause!
This our purpose is, and vow. 

Chorus:
Starve the monster from our shore,
Let his cruel reign be o'er;
Starve the monster from our shore,
Let his cruel reign be o'er.
