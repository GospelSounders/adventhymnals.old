## 551. WAIT, AND MURMUR NOT

```txt
1.
The home where changes never come,
Nor pain nor sorrow, toil nor care;
Yes!  'tis a bright and blessed home;
Who would not fain be resting there?

Chorus:
O, wait, meekly wait, and murmur not,
O, wait, meekly wait, and murmur not,
O, wait, O, wait,
O, wait, and murmur not.

2.
Yet when bow'd down beneath the load
By heav'n allowed, thine earthly lot,
Thou yearn'st to reach that blest abode,
Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not. 

Chorus:
O, wait, meekly wait, and murmur not,
O, wait, meekly wait, and murmur not,
O, wait, O, wait,
O, wait, and murmur not.


3.
If in thy path some thorns are found,
O, think who bore them on His brow;
If grief thy sorrowing heart has found,
It reached a holier than thou. 

Chorus:
O, wait, meekly wait, and murmur not,
O, wait, meekly wait, and murmur not,
O, wait, O, wait,
O, wait, and murmur not.


4.
Toil on, nor deem, tho' sore it be,
One sigh unheard, one pray'r forgot;
The day of rest will dawn for me;
Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not, 

Chorus:
O, wait, meekly wait, and murmur not,
O, wait, meekly wait, and murmur not,
O, wait, O, wait,
O, wait, and murmur not.
