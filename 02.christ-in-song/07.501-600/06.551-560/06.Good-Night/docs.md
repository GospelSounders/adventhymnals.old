## 556. GOOD NIGHT

```txt
1.
When softly fades the dying days,
And mortal cares we fold away,
Then with the last faint ray of light
All nature seems to say good night.

Refrain:
Good night, good night,
May angels bright,
Their vigils keep till morning light,
Good night, good night,
Good night, good night.

2.
And when the deeper shadows fall,
And nature veil as with a pall,
Then pray'rs of evening take their flight
From lips that softly say good night. 

Refrain:
Good night, good night,
May angels bright,
Their vigils keep till morning light,
Good night, good night,
Good night, good night.


3.
O Father, give us sweet repose
From all our earthly cares and woes,
And grant that heav'n may greet our sight
When we have said our last good night. 

Refrain:
Good night, good night,
May angels bright,
Their vigils keep till morning light,
Good night, good night,
Good night, good night.
