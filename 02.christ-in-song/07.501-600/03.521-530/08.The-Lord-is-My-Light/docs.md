## 528. THE LORD IS MY LIGHT

```txt
1.
The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?
By day and by night his presence is near;
He is my salvation from sorrow and sin;
This blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in.

Chorus:
The Lord is my light, my joy and my song;
By day and by night he leads me along.
The Lord is my light, my joy and my song;
By day and by night he leads me along.

2.
The Lord is my light; tho' clouds may arise,
Faith stronger than sight, looks up to the skies
Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign;
Then how can I ever in darkness remain? 

Chorus:
The Lord is my light, my joy and my song;
By day and by night he leads me along.
The Lord is my light, my joy and my song;
By day and by night he leads me along.


3.
The Lord is my light, the Lord is my strength,
I know in his might I'll conquer at length;
My weakness in mercy he covers with pow'r,
And, walking by faith, he upholds me each hour. 

Chorus:
The Lord is my light, my joy and my song;
By day and by night he leads me along.
The Lord is my light, my joy and my song;
By day and by night he leads me along.


4.
The Lord is my light, my all and in all;
There is in his sight no darkness at all;
He is my Redeemer, my Saviour and King;
With saints and with angels his praises I sing. 

Chorus:
The Lord is my light, my joy and my song;
By day and by night he leads me along.
The Lord is my light, my joy and my song;
By day and by night he leads me along.
