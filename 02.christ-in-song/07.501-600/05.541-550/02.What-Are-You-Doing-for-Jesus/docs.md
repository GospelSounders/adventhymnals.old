## 542. WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR JESUS?

```txt
1.
What are you doing for Jesus,
As you journey thro' life?
Sowing the grain for the harvest,
Or scattering seeds of strife?

Chorus:
What are you doing, Doing for Jesus?
What are you doing  As the days go by?
What are you doing, Doing for Jesus?
What are you doing  As the days go by?

2.
What are you doing for Jesus?
Are you striving each day,
By little acts of kindness,
To brighten some ones way? 

Chorus:
What are you doing, Doing for Jesus?
What are you doing  As the days go by?
What are you doing, Doing for Jesus?
What are you doing  As the days go by?


3.
What are you doing for Jesus?
Soon comes setting of sun;
Hasten to tell the glad tidings,
Lest you leave some work undone. 

Chorus:
What are you doing, Doing for Jesus?
What are you doing  As the days go by?
What are you doing, Doing for Jesus?
What are you doing  As the days go by?
