## 546. MISSIONARY'S FAREWELL

```txt
1.
On the shore beyond the sea,
Where the fields are bright and fair,
There's a call a plaintive plea,
I must hasten to be there.

Chorus:
Let me go, I cannot stay,
'Tis the Master calling me;
Let me go, I must obey;
Native land, farewell to thee.

2.
Hark!  I hear the Master say,
"Up, ye reapers!  why so slow?"
To the vineyard, far away,
Earthly kindred, let me go. 

Chorus:
Let me go, I cannot stay,
'Tis the Master calling me;
Let me go, I must obey;
Native land, farewell to thee.


3.
Just beyond the rolling tide,
The uplifted hand I see;
Lo!  the gates are open wide,
And the lost are calling me. 

Chorus:
Let me go, I cannot stay,
'Tis the Master calling me;
Let me go, I must obey;
Native land, farewell to thee.


4.
Father, mother, darling child,
I must bid you all adieu;
For across the waters wild,
There's a work for me to do. 

Chorus:
Let me go, I cannot stay,
'Tis the Master calling me;
Let me go, I must obey;
Native land, farewell to thee.
