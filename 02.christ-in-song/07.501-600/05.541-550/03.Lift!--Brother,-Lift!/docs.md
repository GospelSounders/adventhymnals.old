## 543. LIFT!  BROTHER, LIFT!

```txt
1.
When the cross seems hard to carry,
Lift!  brother, lift!
O'er the burden never tarry,
Lift!  brother, lift!

Chorus:
Lift the cross and clasp it tighter,
Lift!  brother, lift!
Lifting makes the burden lighter,
Lift!  brother, lift!

2.
Duty's call is self-denying,
Lift!  brother, lift!
Half the battle lies in trying,
Lift!  brother, lift! 

Chorus:
Lift the cross and clasp it tighter,
Lift!  brother, lift!
Lifting makes the burden lighter,
Lift!  brother, lift!


3.
When the evil seems the strongest,
Lift!  brother, lift!
Lift the hardest, lift the longest,
Lift!  brother, lift! 

Chorus:
Lift the cross and clasp it tighter,
Lift!  brother, lift!
Lifting makes the burden lighter,
Lift!  brother, lift!
