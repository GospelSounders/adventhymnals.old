## 515. TELL IT TO JESUS

```txt
1.
Are you weary, are you heavy hearted?
Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus,
Are you grieving over joys departed?
Tell it to Jesus alone.

Chorus:
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus,
He is a friend that's well known;
You've no other such a friend or brother,
Tell it to Jesus alone.

2.
Do the tears flow down your checks unbidden?
Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus;
Have you sins that to the world are hidden?
Tell it to Jesus alone. 

Chorus:
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus,
He is a friend that's well known;
You've no other such a friend or brother,
Tell it to Jesus alone.


3.
Do you fear the gath'ring clouds of sorrow?
Tell it to Jesus, Tell it to Jesus;
Are you anxious what shall be tomorrow?  Tell it to Jesus alone. 

Chorus:
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus,
He is a friend that's well known;
You've no other such a friend or brother,
Tell it to Jesus alone.


4.
Are you troubled at the tho't of dying?
Tell it to Jesus, Tell is to Jesus;
For Christ's coming kingdom are you sighing?
Tell it to Jesus alone. 

Chorus:
Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus,
He is a friend that's well known;
You've no other such a friend or brother,
Tell it to Jesus alone.
