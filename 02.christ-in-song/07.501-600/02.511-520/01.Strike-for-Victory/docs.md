## 511. STRIKE FOR VICTORY

```txt
1.
Strike!  O strike for vict'ry,
Soldiers of the Lord,
Hoping in his mercy,
Trusting in his word;
Lift the gospel banner
High above the world;
Let its folds of beauty
Ever be unfurled.

Chorus:
Strike!  strike for vict'ry,
Heroes bold;
Strike!  till the vict'ry
You behold;
Faith is the vict'ry;
Ne'er give o'er;
Rest then in glory
Evermore.

2.
What tho' raging lions
Meet us on the way!
Zionward we're marching,
Tow'rd the gates of day;
Ever pressing onward,
Onward to the light,
Till we reach the Jordan,
With our home in sight. 

Chorus:
Strike!  strike for vict'ry,
Heroes bold;
Strike!  till the vict'ry
You behold;
Faith is the vict'ry;
Ne'er give o'er;
Rest then in glory
Evermore.


3.
Strike!  O strike for vict'ry,
Heroes of the cross,
Sacrificing pleasure,
Glorying in loss;
Blind the helmet stronger,
Tighter grasp the sword;
Conquering and to conquer,
Battle for the Lord. 

Chorus:
Strike!  strike for vict'ry,
Heroes bold;
Strike!  till the vict'ry
You behold;
Faith is the vict'ry;
Ne'er give o'er;
Rest then in glory
Evermore.


4.
Hand to hand united,
Heart to heart as one,
Let us still keep marching
Till our journey's done,
Till we see the angels
Come in glory down,
With the shining garments
And the victor's crown. 

Chorus:
Strike!  strike for vict'ry,
Heroes bold;
Strike!  till the vict'ry
You behold;
Faith is the vict'ry;
Ne'er give o'er;
Rest then in glory
Evermore.
