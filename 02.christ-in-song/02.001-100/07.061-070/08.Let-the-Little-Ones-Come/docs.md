## 68. LET THE LITTLE ONES COME

```txt
1.
I think when I read that sweet story of old,
When Jesus was here among men,
How he call'd little children as lambs to his fold,
I should like to have been with them then.
I wish that his hands had been placed on my head,
That his arm had been thrown around me,
And that I might have seen his kind look when he said,
"Let the little ones come unto me."

2.
Yet still is the Saviour in pray'r I may go,
And ask for a share in his love,
And if I thus earnestly seek him below,
I shall see him and hear him above.
In that beautiful plan he has gone to prepare
For all who are wash'd and forgiv'n,
Oh, may we at last find a glad welcome there,
Safe at home in the kingdom of heav'n.
