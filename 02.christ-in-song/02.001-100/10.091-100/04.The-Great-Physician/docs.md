## 94. THE GREAT PHYSICIAN

```txt
1.
The great Physician now is near,
The sympathizing Jesus;
He speaks, the drooping heart to cheer,
O hear the voice of Jesus!

Chorus:
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue,
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus!

2.
Your many sins are all forgiv'n,
O hear the voice of Jesus;
Go on your way in peace to heav'n,
And wear a crown with Jesus.  

Chorus:
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue,
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus!


3.
All glory to the dying Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus;
I love the blessed Saviour's name,
I love the name of Jesus. 

Chorus:
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue,
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus!


4.
His name dispels my guilt and fear;
No other name but Jesus;
O how my soul delights to hear
The precious name of Jesus! 

Chorus:
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue,
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus!


5.
And when he comes to bring the crown,
The crown of life and glory;
Then by his side we will sit down,
And tell redemption's story. 

Chorus:
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue,
Sweetest carol ever sung,
Jesus, blessed Jesus!
