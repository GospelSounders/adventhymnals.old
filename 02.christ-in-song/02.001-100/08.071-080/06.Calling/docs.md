## 76. CALLING

```txt
1.
Softy and tenderly Jesus is calling,
Calling for you and for me;
At the heart's portal He's waiting and watching,
Watching for you and for me.

Chorus:
Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary, come home;
Earnestly tenderly, Jesus is calling,
Calling, O sinner, come home!

2.
Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,
Pleading for you and for me;
Why should we linger and heed not His mercies,
Mercies for you and for me? 

Chorus:
Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary, come home;
Earnestly tenderly, Jesus is calling,
Calling, O sinner, come home!


3.
Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing,
Passing from you and from me;
Shadows are gath'ring and death's night is coming,
Coming for you and for me. 

Chorus:
Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary, come home;
Earnestly tenderly, Jesus is calling,
Calling, O sinner, come home!


4.
Think of the wonderful love He has promised,
Promised for you and for me;
Tho' we have sinned He has mercy and pardon,
Pardon for you and for me. 

Chorus:
Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary, come home;
Earnestly tenderly, Jesus is calling,
Calling, O sinner, come home!
