## 3. WELCOME!  WANDERER, WELCOME!

```txt
1.
In the land of strangers,
Whither thou art gone,
Hear a far voice calling,
"My son!  my son!"

Chorus:
"Welcome!  wand'rer, welcome!
Welcome back to home!
Thou hast wandered far away;
Come home!  come home!"

2.
"From the land of hunger,
Fainting, famished, lone,
Come to love and gladness,
My son!  my son! 

Chorus:
"Welcome!  wand'rer, welcome!
Welcome back to home!
Thou hast wandered far away;
Come home!  come home!"


3.
"Leave the haunts of riot,
Wasted, woe be gone,
Sick at heart and weary,
My son!  my son! 

Chorus:
"Welcome!  wand'rer, welcome!
Welcome back to home!
Thou hast wandered far away;
Come home!  come home!"


4.
"See the door still open!  
Thou art still my own;
Eyes of love are on thee,
My son!  my son! 

Chorus:
"Welcome!  wand'rer, welcome!
Welcome back to home!
Thou hast wandered far away;
Come home!  come home!"


5.
"Far off thou hast wandered;
Wilt thou farther roam?
Come, and all is pardoned,
My son!  my son! 

Chorus:
"Welcome!  wand'rer, welcome!
Welcome back to home!
Thou hast wandered far away;
Come home!  come home!"


6.
"See the well-spread table,
Unforgotten one!
Here is rest and plenty,
My son!  my son! 

Chorus:
"Welcome!  wand'rer, welcome!
Welcome back to home!
Thou hast wandered far away;
Come home!  come home!"


7.
"Thou art friendless, homeless,
Hopeless, and undone;
Mine is love unchanging,
My son!  my son!" 

Chorus:
"Welcome!  wand'rer, welcome!
Welcome back to home!
Thou hast wandered far away;
Come home!  come home!"
