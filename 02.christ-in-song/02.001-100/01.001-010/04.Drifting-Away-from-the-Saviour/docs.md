## 4. DRIFTING AWAY FROM THE SAVIOUR

```txt
1.
Drifting away from the Saviour,
Casting reproach on the Lord;
Drifting away from His temple,
Heeding no longer His word.

Refrain:
Drifting away, drifting away,
Drifting away from the Saviour,
Drifting, still drifting away.

2.
Drifting away from the Saviour,
Slighting and grieving His love;
Drifting away from the mansions
He is preparing above. 

Refrain:
Drifting away, drifting away,
Drifting away from the Saviour,
Drifting, still drifting away.


3.
Drifting away from the Saviour, 
Lonely and helpless thou art;
Drifting away from His people,
Ever so dear to His heart. 

Refrain:
Drifting away, drifting away,
Drifting away from the Saviour,
Drifting, still drifting away.


4.
Drifting away from the Saviour,
He who has showed you the way;
Drifting away from His teaching,
Farther and farther each day. 

Refrain:
Drifting away, drifting away,
Drifting away from the Saviour,
Drifting, still drifting away.


5.
Drifting away from the Saviour,
Still He is mindful of thee.
Come unto Him and believing,
Pardon'd thro' grace thou shalt be. 

Refrain:
Drifting away, drifting away,
Drifting away from the Saviour,
Drifting, still drifting away.
