## 10. I AM THE WAY

```txt
1.
Like wand'ring sheep o'er mountains cold,
Since all have gone astray;
To "Life" and peace within the fold,
How may I find the way?

Chorus:
I am the way, the truth, and the life:
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.
I am the way, I am the way, 
I am the way, the truth, and the life;
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.

2.
Bewildered oft with doubt and care,
To God I fain would go;
While many cry "Lo here!  lo there!"
The Truth how may I know? 

Chorus:
I am the way, the truth, and the life:
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.
I am the way, I am the way, 
I am the way, the truth, and the life;
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.


3.
To Christ the Way, the Truth, the Life,
I come, no more to roam;
He'll guide me to my "Father's house,
To my eternal home. 

Chorus:
I am the way, the truth, and the life:
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.
I am the way, I am the way, 
I am the way, the truth, and the life;
No man cometh unto the Father but by me.
