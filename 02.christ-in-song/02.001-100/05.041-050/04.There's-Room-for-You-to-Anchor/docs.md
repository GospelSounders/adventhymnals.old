## 44. THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU TO ANCHOR

```txt
1.
There's room for you to anchor
Within the port of rest,
Where tempests all are over,
And calms no more molest;
How sweet to weary voyagers
This precious promise giv'n;
There's room for you to anchor
Safe in heaven!

Refrain:
There's room, there's room;
There's room, there's room;
There's room for you to anchor
Safe in heav'n.

2.
There's room for you to anchor;
The ship is waiting now,
The ship of God's preparing,
O ask not why nor how.
His boundless love and mercy
No tongue can ever tell,
If you but trust his promise,
All is well. 

Refrain:
There's room, there's room;
There's room, there's room;
There's room for you to anchor
Safe in heav'n.


3.
The same dear friends shall meet us
That we have loved below;
The same sweet voices greet us 
As in the long ago.
Then hush!  ye murm'ring waters,
Ye tempests, cease to blow!
I almost hear the music 
Soft and low. 

Refrain:
There's room, there's room;
There's room, there's room;
There's room for you to anchor
Safe in heav'n.


4.
O heaving, swelling billows,
Bear onward to my home!
Beyond these dreary headlands
I see its shining dome.
There, there my fainting spirit
No more for rest shall sigh;
'Tis there I hope to anchor,
By and by. 

Refrain:
There's room, there's room;
There's room, there's room;
There's room for you to anchor
Safe in heav'n.
