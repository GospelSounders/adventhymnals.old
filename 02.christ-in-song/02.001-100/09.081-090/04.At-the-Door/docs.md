## 84. AT THE DOOR

```txt
1.
The mistakes of my life are many,
The sins of my heart are more,
And I scarce can see for weeping,
But I knock at the open door.

Chorus:
I know I am weak and sinful,
It comes to me more and more;
But since the dear Saviour has bid me come in,
I'll enter the open door.

2.
I am lowest of those who love Him,
I am weakest of those who pray;
But I come as He has bidden,
And He will not say me nay. 

Chorus:
I know I am weak and sinful,
It comes to me more and more;
But since the dear Saviour has bid me come in,
I'll enter the open door.


3.
My mistakes His free grace will cover,
My sins He will wash away,
And the feet that shrink and falter,
Shall walk thro' the gates of day. 

Chorus:
I know I am weak and sinful,
It comes to me more and more;
But since the dear Saviour has bid me come in,
I'll enter the open door.
