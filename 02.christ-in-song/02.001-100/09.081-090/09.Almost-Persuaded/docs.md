## 89. ALMOST PERSUADED

```txt
1.
Almost persuaded now to believe.
Almost persuaded Christ to receive.
Seems now some soul to say, 
"Go, Spirit, go Thy way,
Some more convenient day
On Thee I'll call."

2.
Almost persuaded, come, come, today:
Almost persuaded; turn not away.
Jesus invites you here,
Angels are ling'ring near,
Pray'rs rise from hearts so dear:
O wand'rer come!

3.
Almost persuaded; harvest is past!
Almost persuaded; doom comes at last!
"Almost" can not avail,
"Almost" is but to fail!
Sad, and that bitter wail
"Almost, but lost!"
