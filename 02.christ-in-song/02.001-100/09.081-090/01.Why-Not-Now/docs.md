## 81. WHY NOT NOW?

```txt
1.
While we pray and while we plead,
While you see your soul's deep need,
While our Father calls you home,
Will you not, my brother, come?

Chorus:
Why not now?
Why not now?
Why not come to Jesus now?
Why not now?
Why not now?
Why not come to Jesus now?

2.
You have wandered far away,
Do not risk another day;
Do not turn from God your face,
But today accept His grace.  [Chorus}

3.
In the world you've fail'd to find
Aught of peace for troubled mind;
Come to Christ, on Him believe,
Peace and joy you shall receive. 

Chorus:
Why not now?
Why not now?
Why not come to Jesus now?
Why not now?
Why not now?
Why not come to Jesus now?


4.
Come to Christ, confession make;
Come to Christ and pardon take;
Trust in Him from day to day,
He will keep you all the way. 

Chorus:
Why not now?
Why not now?
Why not come to Jesus now?
Why not now?
Why not now?
Why not come to Jesus now?
