## 87. PASS ME NOT

```txt
1.
Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,
Hear my humble cry,
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Chorus:
Saviour, Saviour,
hear my humble cry,
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

2.
Let me at the throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief. 

Chorus:
Saviour, Saviour,
hear my humble cry,
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.


3.
Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace? 

Chorus:
Saviour, Saviour,
hear my humble cry,
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.


4.
Thou the Spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me;
Whom have I on earth beside thee!
Whom in heav'n but Thee? 

Chorus:
Saviour, Saviour,
hear my humble cry,
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.
