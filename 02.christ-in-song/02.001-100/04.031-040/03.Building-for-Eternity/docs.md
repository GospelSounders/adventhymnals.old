## 33. BUILDING FOR ETERNITY

```txt
1.
We are building in sorrow or joy
A temple the world may not see,
Which time cannot mar nor destroy:
We build for eternity.

Chorus:
We are building, ev'ry day,
A temple the world may not see;
Building, building ev'ry day,
Building for eternity!

2.
Ev'ry tho't that we've ever had,
Its own little place has fill'd;
Ev'ry deed we have done, good or bad,
Is a stone in the temple we build. 

Chorus:
We are building, ev'ry day,
A temple the world may not see;
Building, building ev'ry day,
Building for eternity!


3.
Ev'ry word that so lightly falls,
Giving some heart joy or pain,
Will shine in our temple wall,
Or ever its beauty stain. 

Chorus:
We are building, ev'ry day,
A temple the world may not see;
Building, building ev'ry day,
Building for eternity!


4.
Are you building for God alone?
Are you building in faith and love,
A temple the Father will own,
In the city of light above? 

Chorus:
We are building, ev'ry day,
A temple the world may not see;
Building, building ev'ry day,
Building for eternity!
