## 38. THE PASSOVER

```txt
1.
The day is dead, and Egypt's night returning,
Is dark and still in death's prophetic gloom.
The world sleeps on, but Israel's lamp is burning;
At midnight sounds the' oppressor's note of doom.

Refrain:
"I will pass over you, when I see the blood:"
I will pass over you, 'tis a saving flood.
"I will pass over you, when I see the blood,"
The precious blood of Jesus. 

2.
The Lamb is slain, the Sacrifice immortal,
Whose life received creates the soul anew;
His blood is shed, but is it on the portal?
O haste and see!  doth it avail for you? 

Refrain:
"I will pass over you, when I see the blood:"
I will pass over you, 'tis a saving flood.
"I will pass over you, when I see the blood,"
The precious blood of Jesus. 


3.
Not there?  not there?  no crimson on the lintel?
Delay!  delay!  O thou destroying One!
Give grace?  give grace!  it must be more than mental:
My heart!  my heart!  let there thy work be done. 

Refrain:
"I will pass over you, when I see the blood:"
I will pass over you, 'tis a saving flood.
"I will pass over you, when I see the blood,"
The precious blood of Jesus. 


4.
Art safe, my soul!  rest not in thy salvation,
Else thou art not like Him who came to die;
In love go forth with mercy's invitation,
Awake the world!  death's angel passes by. 

Refrain:
"I will pass over you, when I see the blood:"
I will pass over you, 'tis a saving flood.
"I will pass over you, when I see the blood,"
The precious blood of Jesus.
