## 12. "WHOSOEVER WILL"

```txt
1.
"Whosoever heareth," shout, shout the sound!
Send the blessed tidings all the world around;
Spread the joyful news wherever man is found:
"Whosoever will, may come."

Chorus:
"Whosoever will, whosoever will,"
Send the proclamation over vale and hill;
'Tis a loving Father calls the wand'rer home:
"Whosoever will, may come."

2.
Whosoever cometh need not delay,
Now the door is open, enter while you may;
Jesus is the true, the only Living Way:
"Whosoever will, may come." 

Chorus:
"Whosoever will, whosoever will,"
Send the proclamation over vale and hill;
'Tis a loving Father calls the wand'rer home:
"Whosoever will, may come."


3.
"Whosoever will," the promise secure,
"Whosoever will," for ever must endure;
"Whosoever will," 'Tis life for evermore:
"Whosoever will, may come." 

Chorus:
"Whosoever will, whosoever will,"
Send the proclamation over vale and hill;
'Tis a loving Father calls the wand'rer home:
"Whosoever will, may come."
