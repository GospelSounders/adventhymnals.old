## 16. "COME UNTO ME"

```txt
1.
O heart bowed down with sorrow!
O eyes that long for sight!
There's gladness in believing;
In Jesus there is light.

Refrain:
"Come unto me, all ye that labor, 
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;
for I am meek and lowly in heart:
and ye shall find rest unto your souls."

2.
Earth's fleeting gain and pleasure
Can never satisfy;
'Tis love our joy doth measure,
For love can never die. 

Refrain:
"Come unto me, all ye that labor, 
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;
for I am meek and lowly in heart:
and ye shall find rest unto your souls."


3.
Divinest consolation
Doth Christ the Healer give;
Art thou in condemnation?
Repent, believe and live. 

Refrain:
"Come unto me, all ye that labor, 
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;
for I am meek and lowly in heart:
and ye shall find rest unto your souls."


4.
His peace is like a river,
His love is like a song;
His yoke's a burden never;
'Tis easy all day long. 

Refrain:
"Come unto me, all ye that labor, 
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;
for I am meek and lowly in heart:
and ye shall find rest unto your souls."
