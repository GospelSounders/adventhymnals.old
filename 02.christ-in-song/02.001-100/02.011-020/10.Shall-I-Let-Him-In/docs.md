## 20. SHALL I LET HIM IN?

```txt
1.
Christ is knocking at my sad heart;
Shall I let him in?
Patiently pleading with my sad heart;
O shall I let him in?
Cold and proud is my heart with sin,
Dark and cheerless is all within;
Christ is bidding me turn unto him;
O shall I let him in?

2.
Shall I send him the loving word?
Shall I let him in?
Meekly accepting my gracious Lord,
O shall I let him in?
He can infinite love impart,
He can pardon this rebel heart;
Shall I bid him forever depart,
Or shall I let him in?

3.
Yes, I'll open this heart's proud decor,
Yes, I'll let him in.
Gladly I'll welcome him evermore;
O, yes, I'll let him in.
Blessed Saviour, abide with me,
Cares and trials will lighter be;
I am safe if I'm only with thee,
O, blessed Lord, come in!
