## 931. SWEET BE THY REST

```txt
1.
Sweet be thy rest,
And peaceful thy sleeping;
God's way is best,
Thou art in his keeping.
O blessed sleep,
Where ills ne'er molest thee!
Why should we weep?
For heaven hath blessed thee:
Sweet be thy rest.

2.
Thy work is done,
Thy sowing and reaping;
Thy crown is won,
And hush'd is thy weeping.
From tears and woes,
From earth's midnight dreary,
Thine is repose
Where none ever weary:
Sweet be thy rest.

3.
Sweet be thy rest;
No more we may greet thee
Till with the blest
In heaven we meet thee.
O union sweet,
That death can not sever!
There we shall meet,
Where sad tears fall never:
Sweet be thy rest.
```
