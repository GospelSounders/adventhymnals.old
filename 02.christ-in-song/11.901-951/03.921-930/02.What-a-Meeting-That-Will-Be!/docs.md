## 922. WHAT A MEETING THAT WILL BE!

```txt
1.
When Jesus calls His jewels
From ev'ry land and sea,
And takes them home to glory,
What a meeting that will be!

Refrain:
We'll meet them in glory,
Meet them in glory,
Meet them in glory;
What a meeting that will be!

2.
We'll meet the friends departed,
The loved ones called away;
Not one will be forgotten
In the glad reunion day. 

Refrain:
We'll meet them in glory,
Meet them in glory,
Meet them in glory;
What a meeting that will be!


3.
We'll meet the kings and prophets
Of ages long ago,
And all the faithful martyrs
Who bled for truth below. 

Refrain:
We'll meet them in glory,
Meet them in glory,
Meet them in glory;
What a meeting that will be!


4.
We'll meet in all His beauty
The One whom we adore,
Who died that we, believing,
May live forevermore. 

Refrain:
We'll meet them in glory,
Meet them in glory,
Meet them in glory;
What a meeting that will be!
