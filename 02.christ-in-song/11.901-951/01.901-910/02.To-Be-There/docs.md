## 902. TO BE THERE

```txt
1.
We speak of the realms of the blest,
That country so bright and so fair,
And oft are its glories confess'd,
But what must it be to be there!
We speak of its streets of pure gold,
Its walls deck'd with jewels so rare,
Its wonders and pleasures untold,
But what must it be to be there!

2.
We speak of its freedom from sin,
From sorrow, temptation and care,
From trials without and within,
But what must it be to be there!
We speak of its service of love,
And robes which the glorified wear,
The church of the firstborn above,
But what must it be to be there!

3.
Do Thee, midst temptation and woe,
For heaven my spirit prepare,
And shortly I also shall know
And feel what it is to be there;
Then o'er the bright fields we shall roam,
In glory celestial and fair,
With saints and with angels at home,
And Jesus himself will be there.
