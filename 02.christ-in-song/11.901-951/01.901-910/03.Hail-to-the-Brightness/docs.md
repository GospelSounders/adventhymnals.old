## 903. HAIL TO THE BRIGHTNESS

```txt
1.
Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning!
Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain!
Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mourning:
Zion, in triumph, begins her mild reign.

2.
Lo, in the desert, rich flowers are springing;
Streams ever copious are gliding along;
Loud, from the mountaintops, echoes are ringing;
Wastes rise in verdure, and mingle in song.

3.
See, the dead risen from land and from ocean;
Praise to Jehovah, ascending on high;
Fall'n are the engines of war and commotion;
Shouts of salvation are rending the sky.
