## 909. EVERGREEN SHORE

```txt
1.
We are joyously voyaging over the main,
Bound for the evergreen shore,
Whose inhabitants never of sickness complain,
And never see death any more.

Chorus:
Then let the hurricane roar,
It will the sooner be o'er;
We will weather the blast, and we'll land at last,
Safe on the evergreen shore.

2.
We have nothing to fear from the wind and the wave,
Under our Saviour's command;
And our hearts in the midst of the dangers are brave,
For Jesus will bring us to land. 

Chorus:
Then let the hurricane roar,
It will the sooner be o'er;
We will weather the blast, and we'll land at last,
Safe on the evergreen shore.


3.
Both the wind and the wave our Commander controls,
Nothing can baffle his skill;
And his voice when the thundering hurricane rolls,
Can make the loud tempest be still. 

Chorus:
Then let the hurricane roar,
It will the sooner be o'er;
We will weather the blast, and we'll land at last,
Safe on the evergreen shore.


4.
In the thick murky night, when the stars and the moon,
Send not a glimmering ray,
Then the light of his countenance, brighter than noon,
Will drive all our terror away. 

Chorus:
Then let the hurricane roar,
It will the sooner be o'er;
We will weather the blast, and we'll land at last,
Safe on the evergreen shore.


5.
Let the high-heaving billows and mountainous wave,
Fearfully overhead break;
There is One by our side that can comfort and save,
There is One who will never forsake. 

Chorus:
Then let the hurricane roar,
It will the sooner be o'er;
We will weather the blast, and we'll land at last,
Safe on the evergreen shore.
