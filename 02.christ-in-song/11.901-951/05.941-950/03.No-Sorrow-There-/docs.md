## 943. NO SORROW THERE 

```txt
1.
There'll be no grief in heav'n;
For life is one glad day,
And tears are of those former things
Which all have passed away.

Refrain:
There'll be no sorrow there,
There'll be no sorrow there;
In heav'n above, where all is love,
There'll be no sorrow there.

2.
There'll be no sin in heav'n;
Behold that blessed throng,
All holy in their spotless robes,
All holy in their song. 

Refrain:
There'll be no sorrow there,
There'll be no sorrow there;
In heav'n above, where all is love,
There'll be no sorrow there.


3.
There'll be no death in heav'n;
For they who gain that shore
Have won their immortality,
And they can die no more.

Refrain:
There'll be no sorrow there,
There'll be no sorrow there;
In heav'n above, where all is love,
There'll be no sorrow there.
