## 248. O, HOW I LOVE JESUS

```txt
1.
There is a Name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in my ears,
The sweetest Name on earth.


Refrain:
O how I love Jesus,
O how I love Jesus,
O how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me.


2.
It tells me of a Savior’s love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of a Savior’s blood,
The sinners’ perfect plea.


Refrain:
O how I love Jesus,
O how I love Jesus,
O how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me.

3.
It tells of one whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe;
Who in each sorrow bears
A part that none can bear below.

Refrain:
O how I love Jesus,
O how I love Jesus,
O how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me.
