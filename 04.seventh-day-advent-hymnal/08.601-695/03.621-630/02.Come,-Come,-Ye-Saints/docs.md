## 622. COME, COME, YE SAINTS

```txt
1.
Come, come, ye saints, no toil nor labor fear;
But with joy wend your way.
Though hard to you the journey may appear,
Grace shall be as your day.
We will have a living lord to guide,
And we can trust Him to provide;
Do this, and joy your hearts will swell:All is well! All is well!

2.
We’ll find the rest which God for us prepared,
When at last He will call;
Where none will come to hurt or make afraid,
He will reign over all.
We will make the air with music ring,
Shout praise to God our Lord and King:
O how we’ll make the chorus swell:
All is well! All is well!
