## 133. NOW IS BORN THE DIVINE CHRIST CHILD

```txt
1.
He was born in a stable bare,
On bed of straw how He sleeps so soundly,
He was born in a stable bare,
Let us worship and to Him bow.

2.
Ages long since are past and gone,
When the wise men foretold His coming,
Ages long since are past and gone,
When the wise men foretold His birth.
