## 111. IT TOOK A MIRACLE

```txt
1.
My Father is omnipotent
And that you can’t deny;
A God of might and miracles;
‘Tis written in the sky.


Refrain:
It took a miracle to put the stars in place;
It took a miracle to hang the world in space.
But when He saved my soul,
Cleansed and made me whole,
It took a miracle of love and grace!


2.
Though here His glory has been shown,
We still can’t fully see
The wonders of His might, His throne;
‘Till eternity.


Refrain:
It took a miracle to put the stars in place;
It took a miracle to hang the world in space.
But when He saved my soul,
Cleansed and made me whole,
It took a miracle of love and grace!

3.
The Bible tells us of His power
And wisdom all way through;
And every little bird and flower
Are testimonies, too.

Refrain:
It took a miracle to put the stars in place;
It took a miracle to hang the world in space.
But when He saved my soul,
Cleansed and made me whole,
It took a miracle of love and grace!
