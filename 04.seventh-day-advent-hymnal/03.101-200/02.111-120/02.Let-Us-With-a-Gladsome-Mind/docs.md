## 112. LET US WITH A GLADSOME MIND

```txt
1.
Let us with a gladsome mind
Praise the Lord, for He is kind:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

2.
He, with all commanding might,
Filled the new made world with light:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

3.
All things living He does feed;
His full hand supplies their need:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

4.
Let us then with gladsome mind
Praise the Lord, for He is kind:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.
