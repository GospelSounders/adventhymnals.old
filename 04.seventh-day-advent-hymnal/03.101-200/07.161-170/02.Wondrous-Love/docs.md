## 162. WONDROUS LOVE

```txt
1.
What wondrous love is this,
O my soul, O my soul?
What wondrous love is this, O my soul?
What wondrous love is this
That caused the Lord of bliss
To bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul;
To bear the dreadful curse for my soul, for my soul;

2.
To God and to the Lamb
I will sing, I will sing;
To God and to the Lamb, I will sing;
To God and to the Lamb
Who is the great I am,
While millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing;
While millions join the theme, I will sing, I will sing;

3.
And when from death I’m free,
I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on;
And when from death I’m free, I’ll sing on;
And when from death I’m free,
I’ll sing and joyful be,
And through eternity I’ll sing on, I’ll sing on!
And through eternity, I’ll sing on.
