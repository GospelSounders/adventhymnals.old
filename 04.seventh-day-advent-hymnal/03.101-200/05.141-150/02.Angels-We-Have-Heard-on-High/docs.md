## 142. ANGELS WE HAVE HEARD ON HIGH

```txt
1.
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing oâ€™er the plains,
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains.


Refrain:
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!


2.
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?


Refrain:
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

3.
Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ Whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee,
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.


Refrain:
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

4.
See Him in a manger laid,
Whom the choirs of angels praise;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
While our hearts in love we raise.

Refrain:
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
