## 183. I WILL SING OF JESUS` LOVE

```txt
1.
I Will sing of Jesus love,
Sing of Him,who first loved me;
for He left bright worlds above,
And died on Calvary.


Refrain:
I will sing of Jesus love
Endless praise my heart shall give;
He has died that I might live
I will sing His love to me.


2.
O the depths of love divine!
Earth or heaven can never know
How that sin as dark as mine
can be made as white as snow.


Refrain:
I will sing of Jesus love
Endless praise my heart shall give;
He has died that I might live
I will sing His love to me.

3.
Nothing good for Him Iâ€™ve done;
How could He such love bestow?
Lord, I own my heart is won,
help me now my love to show.

Refrain:
I will sing of Jesus love
Endless praise my heart shall give;
He has died that I might live
I will sing His love to me.
