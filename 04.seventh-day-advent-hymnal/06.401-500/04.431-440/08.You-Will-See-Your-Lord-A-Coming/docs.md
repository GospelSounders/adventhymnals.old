```txt
1.
You will see your Lord a-coming,
You will see your Lord a-coming,
You will see your Lord a-coming
In a few more days.


Refrain:
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music
which is sounding thro’ the air.


2.
Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet,
Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet,
Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet
In a few more days.


Refrain:
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music
which is sounding thro’ the air.

3.
You will see the saints arising,
You will see the saints arising,
You will see the saints arising
In a few more days.

Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music
which is sounding thro’ the air.

Angels bear them to the Savior,
Angels bear them to the Savior,
Angels bear them to the Savior
In a few more days.


Refrain:
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music
which is sounding thro’ the air.

5.
Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over,
Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over,
Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over
In a few more days.

Refrain:
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music
which is sounding thro’ the air.
