## 414. FRUITFUL TREES, THE SPIRIT`S SOWING

```txt
1.
Fruitful trees, the Spirit’s sowing,
May we ripen and increase,
Fruit to life eternal growing,
Rich in love and joy and peace.

2.
Laden branches freely bearing
Gifts the Giver loves to bless;
Here is fruit that grows by sharing,
Patience, kindness, gentleness.

3.
Rooted deep in Christ, our Master,
Christ, our pattern and our goal,
Teach us, as the years fly faster,
Goodness, faith, and self control.

4.
Fruitful trees, the Spirit’s tending,
May we grow till harvests cease;
Till we taste, in life unending,
Heaven’s love and joy and peace.
