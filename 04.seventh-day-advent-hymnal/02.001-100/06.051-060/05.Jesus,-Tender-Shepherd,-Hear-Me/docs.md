## 55. JESUS, TENDER SHEPHERD, HEAR ME

```txt
1.
Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,
Bless Thy little lamb tonight;
Through the darkness be Thou near me;
Watch my sleep till morning light.

2.
All this day Thy hand has led me,
And I thank Thee for Thy care;
Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me;
Listen to my evening prayer.
```
