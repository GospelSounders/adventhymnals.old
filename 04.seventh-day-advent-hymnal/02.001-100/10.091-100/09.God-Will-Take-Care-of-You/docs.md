## 99. GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU

```txt
1.
Be not dismayed whate’er betide,
God will take care of you;
beneath his wings of love abide,
God will take care of you.


Refrain:
God will take care of you,
through every day, o’er all the way;
he will take care of you,
God will take care of you.


2.
Through days of toil when heart doth fail,
God will take care of you;
when dangers fierce your path assail,
God will take care of you.


Refrain:
God will take care of you,
through every day, o’er all the way;
he will take care of you,
God will take care of you.

3.
All you may need he will provide,
God will take care of you;
nothing you ask will be denied,
God will take care of you.


Refrain:
God will take care of you,
through every day, o’er all the way;
he will take care of you,
God will take care of you.

4.
No matter what may be the test,
God will take care of you;
lean, weary one, upon his breast,
God will take care of you.

Refrain:
God will take care of you,
through every day, o’er all the way;
he will take care of you,
God will take care of you.
