## 391. WELCOME, WELCOME, DAY OF REST

```txt
1.
To the world in kindness given;
Welcome to this humble breast,
As the beaming light from heaven.

2.
Day of calm and sweet repose,
Gently now thy moments run;
Balm to soothe our cares and woes,
Till our labor here is done.

3.
Holy day that most we prize,
Day of solemn praise and prayer,
Day to make the simple wise,
O, how great thy blessings are!

4.
Welcome, welcome, day of rest,
With thy influence all divine;
May thy hallowed hours be blessed
to this waiting heart of mine.
```
