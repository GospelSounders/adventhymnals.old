## 328. MUST JESUS BEAR THE CROSS ALONE

```txt
1.
Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
and all the world go free?
No, there’s a cross for everyone,
and there’s a cross for me.

2.
The consecrated cross I’ll bear
till He shall set me free;
and then go home my crown to wear,
for there’s a crown for me.

3.
Upon the crystal pavement, down
at Jesus’ pierced feet,
with joy I’ll cast my golden crown,
and His dear name repeat.
```
