## 367. RESCUE THE PERISHING

```txt
1.
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
weep oâ€™er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.


Refrain:
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.


2.
Though they are slighting him, still he is waiting,
waiting the penitent child to receive;
plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
he will forgive if they only believe.


Refrain:
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

3.
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;
strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
back to the narrow way patiently win them;
tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died.

Refrain:
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.
