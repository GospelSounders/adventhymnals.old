## 581. MY HOPE IS BUILT ON NOTHING LESS

```txt
1.
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.
CHORUS:
On Christ the solid rock I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

2.
When Darkness seems to veil His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace.
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

3.
His oath, His covenant, and blood
Supports me in the whelming flood.
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

4.
When He shall come with trumpet sound,
O may I then in Him be found!
Clad in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.
```
