## 588. 'TIS SO SWEET TO TRUST IN JESUS

```txt
1.
'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to take Him at His word; 
Just to rest upon His promise, 
Just to know, Thus saith the Lord. 
CHORUS:
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him! 
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er!
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus! 
O for grace to trust Him more! 

2.
O how sweet to trust in Jesus, 
Just to trust His cleansing blood; 
Just in simple faith to plunge me 
'Neath the healing, cleansing flood!

3.
Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just from sin and self to cease; 
Just from Jesus simply taking 
Life and rest, and joy and peace. 

4.
I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee,
Precious Jesus, Savior, friend; 
And I know that Thou art with me, 
Wilt be with me to the end.
