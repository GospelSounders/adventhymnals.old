## 585. THE LORD'S OUR ROCK

```txt
1.
The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide, 
A shelter in the time of storm; 
Secure whatever may betide, 
A shelter in the time of storm. 

Refrain:
Mighty Rock in a weary land, 
Cooling shade on the burning sand; 
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band' 
A Shelter in the time of storm. 

2.
A shade by day, defense by night, 
A shelter in the time of storm; 
No fears alarm, no foes affright, 
A shelter in the time of storm. 

Refrain:
Mighty Rock in a weary land, 
Cooling shade on the burning sand; 
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band' 
A Shelter in the time of storm. 

3.
The raging floods may round us beat, 
A shelter in the time of storm 
We find in God a safe retreat, 
A shelter in the time of storm. 

Refrain:
Mighty Rock in a weary land, 
Cooling shade on the burning sand; 
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band' 
A Shelter in the time of storm. 

4.
O Rock divine, O Refuge dear, 
A shelter in the time of storm; 
Be Thou our Helper, ever near, 
A shelter in the time of storm.

Refrain:
Mighty Rock in a weary land, 
Cooling shade on the burning sand; 
Faithful guide for the pilgrim band' 
A Shelter in the time of storm.
