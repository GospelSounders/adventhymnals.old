## 556. ANGEL VOICES SWEETLY SINGING

```txt
1.
Angel voices sweetly singing, 
Echoes through the blue dome ringing, 
News of wondrous gladness bringing; 
Ah, 'tis heaven at last! 
REFRAIN:
Heaven at last, heaven at last; 
O, the joyful story of heaven at last! 
Heaven at last, heaven at last; 
Endless, boundless glory, In heaven at last. 

2.
On the jasper threshold standing, 
Like a pilgrim safely landing, 
See the strange bright scene expanding; 
Ah, 'tis heaven at last! 

3.
Softest voices, silver pealing, 
Freshest fragrance, spirit healing, 
Happy hymns around us stealing; 
Ah, 'tis heaven at last! 

4.
Not a teardrop ever falleth, 
Not a pleasure ever palleth, 
Song to song forever calleth; 
Ah, 'tis heaven at last! 

5.
Christ Himself the living splendor, 
Christ the sunlight, mild and tender;v 
Praise to the Lamb we render; 
Ah, 'tis heaven at last!
