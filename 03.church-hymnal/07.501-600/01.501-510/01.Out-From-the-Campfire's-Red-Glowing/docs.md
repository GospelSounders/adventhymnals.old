## 501. OUT FROM THE CAMPFIRE'S RED GLOWING

```txt
1.
Out from the campfire's red glowing, 
Cheerfully shedding its light, 
On to the pickets we're going, 
For the long watches of night; 
Let us be careful that slumber 
Press not our eyelids too hard' 
Surely not one of our number 
Must be found sleeping on guard. 

Refrain:
Yes, sleeping on guard, 
Sleeping on guard, 
No! surely not one of our number 
Must be found sleeping on guard. 

2.
Yonder Rum's camp lights are burning; 
Hark to the revelry there! 
Waiting the conflict returning, 
Scouts are abroad everywhere; 
We must be watchful and ready, 
See every entrance is barred, 
Keeping our heads cool and steady' 
All is lost, sleeping on guard. 

Refrain:
Yes, sleeping on guard, 
Sleeping on guard, 
No! surely not one of our number 
Must be found sleeping on guard. 

3.
Our aim is vigilance ever, 
We can allow no defeat; 
Truehearted soldiers will never 
Join in the coward's retreat; 
Wary and watchful be keeping, 
Though the task be e'er so hard, 
Knowing what dangers come creeping 
When we are sleeping on guard.

Refrain:
Yes, sleeping on guard, 
Sleeping on guard, 
No! surely not one of our number 
Must be found sleeping on guard.
