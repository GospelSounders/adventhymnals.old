## 502. MOURN FOR THE THOUSANDS SLAIN

```txt
1.
Mourn for the thousands slain, 
The youthful and the strong; 
Mourn for the wine cup's fearful reign, 
And the deluded throng. 

2.
Mourn for the lost'but call, 
Call to the strong, the free; 
Rouse them to shun that dreadful fall, 
And to the Refuge flee. 

3.
Mourn for the lost'but pray, 
Pray to our God above, 
To break the fell destroyer's sway, 
And show His saving love.
