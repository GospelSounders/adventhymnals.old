## 550. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY OF EDEN

```txt
1.
Beautiful valley of Eden, 
Sweet is thy noontide calm; 
Over the hearts of the weary, 
Breathing thy waves of balm. 
REFRAIN:
Beautiful valley of Eden, 
Home of the pure and blest, 
How often amid the wild billows 
I dream of thy rest, sweet rest! 

2.
Over the heart of the mourner 
Shineth the golden day, 
Wafting the songs of the angels 
Down from the far away. 

3.
There is the home of my Saviour; 
There, with the blood-washed throng, 
Over the highlands of glory 
Rolleth the great new song.
