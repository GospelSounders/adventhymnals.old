## 542. WE KNOW NOT THE TIME WHEN HE COMETH

```txt
1.
We know not the time when he cometh, 
At even, or midnight, or morn; 
It may be at deepening twilight, 
It may be at earliest dawn. 
He bids us to watch and be ready, 
Nor suffer our lights to grow dim; 
That, when he may come, he will find us 
All waiting and watching for him. 

Refrain:
Waiting and watching, 
Waiting and watching, 
Waiting and watching, 
Still waiting and watching for him. 

2.
I think of his wonderful pity, 
The price our salvation hath cost; 
He left the bright mansions of glory 
To suffer and die for the lost. 
And, sometimes, I think it will please him, 
When those whom he died to redeem, 
Rejoice in the hope of his coming, 
By waiting and watching for him. 

Refrain:
Waiting and watching, 
Waiting and watching, 
Waiting and watching, 
Still waiting and watching for him. 

3.
O Jesus, my loving Redeemer, 
Thou knowest I cherish as dear 
The hope that mine eyes shall behold thee, 
That I shall thine own welcome hear. 
If to some as a judge thou appearest, 
Who forth from thy presence would flee, 
A Friend most beloved I'll greet thee; 
I'm waiting and watching for thee.

Refrain:
Waiting and watching, 
Waiting and watching, 
Waiting and watching, 
Still waiting and watching for him.
