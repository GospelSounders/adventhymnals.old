## 569. JESUS IS TENDERLY CALLING 

```txt
1.
Jesus is tenderly calling thee home' 
Calling today, calling today; 
Why from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam 
Farther and farther away? 
REFRAIN:
Calling today, calling today; 
Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today. 

2.
Jesus is calling the weary to rest' 
Calling today, calling today; 
Bring Him thy burden, and thou shalt be blest; 
He will not turn thee away. 

3.
Jesus is waiting'oh, come to Him now' 
Waiting today, waiting today; 
Come with thy sins, at His feet lowly bow; 
Come, and no longer delay. 

4.
Jesus is pleading'oh, list to His voice' 
Hear Him today, hear Him today; 
They who believe on His name shall rejoice; 
Quickly arise and away.
