## 561. THERE IS A GATE THAT STANDS AJAR

```txt
1.
There is a gate that stands ajar, 
And through its portals gleaming, 
A radiance from the cross afar, 
The Saviour's love revealing. 
REFRAIN:
O depth of mercy! can it be 
That gate was left ajar for me? 
For me, for me? 
Was left ajar for me? 

2.
That gate ajar stands free for all 
Who seek through it salvation; 
The rich and poor, the great and small 
Of every tribe and nation. 

3.
Press onward, then, though foes may frown; 
While mercy's gate is open 
Accept the cross, and win the crown, 
Love's everlasting token. 

4.
Beyond the river's brink we'll lay 
The cross that here is given, 
And bear the crown of life away, 
And love Him more in heaven.
```
