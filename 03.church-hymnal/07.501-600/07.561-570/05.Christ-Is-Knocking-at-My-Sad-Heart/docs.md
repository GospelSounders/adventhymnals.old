## 565. CHRIST IS KNOCKING AT MY SAD HEART

```txt
1.
Christ is knocking at my sad heart; 
Shall I let Him in? 
Patiently pleading with my sad heart; 
O shall I let Him in? 
Cold and proud is my heart with sin, 
Dark and cheerless is all within; 
Christ is bidding me turn unto Him; 
O shall I let Him in? 

2.
Shall I send Him the loving word? 
Shall I let Him in? 
Meekly accepting my gracious Lord, 
O shall I let Him in? 
He can infinite love impart, 
He can pardon this rebel heart; 
Shall I bid Him forever depart, 
Or shall I let Him in? 

3.
Yes, I'll open this proud heart's door, 
Yes, I'll let Him in. 
Gladly I'll welcome Him evermore; 
O, yes,' I'll let Him in. 
Blessed Saviour, abide with me, 
Cares and trials will lighter be; 
I am safe if I'm only with Thee, 
O, blessed Lord, come in!
