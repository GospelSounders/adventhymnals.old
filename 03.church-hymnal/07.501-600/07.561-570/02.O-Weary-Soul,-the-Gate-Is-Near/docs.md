## 562. O WEARY SOUL, THE GATE IS NEAR

```txt
1.
O weary soul, the gate is near, 
In sin why still abide? 
Both peace and rest are waiting here, 
And you are just outside. 
REFRAIN:
Just outside the door, just outside the door, 
Behold, it stands ajar! 
Just outside the door, just outside the door, 
So near and yet so far! 

2.
Forgiveness Jesus will impart, 
To save your soul He died; 
How can you still offend His heart 
By staying just outside? 

3.
The day of life is passing by; 
Soon night your soul will hide; 
And then "Too late" will be your cry, 
If you are just outside! 

4.
Come in, be free from stains of sin, 
Be glad, be satisfied; 
Before the tempest breaks, come in, 
And leave your past outside.
```
