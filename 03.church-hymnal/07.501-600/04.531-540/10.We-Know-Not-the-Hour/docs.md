## 540. WE KNOW NOT THE HOUR

```txt
1.
We know not the hour of the Master's appearing;
Yet signs all foretell that the moment is nearing
When He shall return 'tis a promise most cheering
But we know not the hour.
CHORUS:
He will come (He will come), let us watch and be ready;
He will come (He will come), hallelujah! hallelujah!
He will come in the clouds of His Father's bright glory--
But we know not the hour.

2.
There's light for the wise who are seeking salvation;
There's truth in the book of the Lord's revelation;
Each prophecy points to the great comsummation
But we know not the hour.

3.
We'll watch and we'll pray, with our lamps trimmed and burning;
We'll work and we'll wait till the Master's returning;
We'll sing and rejoice, every omen discerning
But we know not the hour.
```
