## 535. 'TIS FINISHED!

```txt
1.
"'Tis finished!" so the Saviour cried, 
And meekly bowed His head, and died; 
'Tis finished! yes, the race is run, 
The battle fought, the victory won. 

2.
'Tis finished! that which heaven foretold 
By prophets in the days of old; 
And truths are opened to our view 
That kings and prophets never knew.

3.
'Tis finished! Son of God, Thy power 
Hath triumphed in this awful hour; 
And yet our eyes with sorrow see 
That life to us was death to Thee.

4.
'Tis finished! let the joyful sound 
Be heard through all the nations round; 
'Tis finished! let the triumph rise, 
And swell the chorus of the skies!
