## 529. I WILL SING OF JESUS' LOVE

```txt
1.
I Will sing of Jesus' love, 
Sing of Him, who first loved me; 
For He left bright worlds above, 
And died on Calvary. 

Refrain:
I will sing of Jesus love 
Endless praise my heart shall give; 
He has died that I might live 
I will sing His love to me. 

2.
Ere a tear had dimmed mine eyes, 
Jesus' tears for me did flow; 
Ere my first faint prayer could rise, 
He had prayed in tones of woe. 

Refrain:
I will sing of Jesus love 
Endless praise my heart shall give; 
He has died that I might live 
I will sing His love to me. 

3.
O the depths of love divine! 
Earth or heaven can never know 
How that sins as dark as mine 
can be made as white as snow. 

Refrain:
I will sing of Jesus love 
Endless praise my heart shall give; 
He has died that I might live 
I will sing His love to me. 

4.
Nothing good for Him I've done; 
How could He such love bestow? 
Lord, I own my heart is won, 
Help me now my love to show.

Refrain:
I will sing of Jesus love 
Endless praise my heart shall give; 
He has died that I might live 
I will sing His love to me.
