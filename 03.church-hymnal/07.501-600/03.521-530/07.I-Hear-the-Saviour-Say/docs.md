## 527. I HEAR THE SAVIOUR SAY

```txt
1.
I hear the Savior say, 
'Thy strength indeed is small, 
Child of weakness, watch and pray, 
Find in Me thine all in all.' 

Refrain:
Jesus paid it all, 
All to Him I owe; 
Sin had left a crimson stain; 
He washed it white as snow. 

2.
Lord, now indeed I find 
Thy power, and Thine alone, 
Can change the leper's spots, 
And melt the heart of stone. 

Refrain:
Jesus paid it all, 
All to Him I owe; 
Sin had left a crimson stain; 
He washed it white as snow. 

3.
Since nothing good have I 
Whereby Thy grace to claim, 
I'll wash my garments white 
In the blood of Calvary's Lamb. 

Refrain:
Jesus paid it all, 
All to Him I owe; 
Sin had left a crimson stain; 
He washed it white as snow. 

4.
And when before the throne 
I stand in Him complete, 
I'll lay my trophies down, 
All down at Jesus' feet.

Refrain:
Jesus paid it all, 
All to Him I owe; 
Sin had left a crimson stain; 
He washed it white as snow.
