## 257. CALL JEHOVAH THY SALVATION

```txt
1.
Call Jehovah thy salvation, 
Rest beneath th' Almighty's shade; 
In his secret habitation 
Dwell, and never be dismayed. 

2.
Since, with pure and firm affection 
Thou on God hast set thy love, 
With the wings of his protection 
He will shield thee from above. 

3.
Thou shalt call on him in trouble, 
He will hearken, He will save; 
For thy grief reward thee double, 
Crown with life beyond the grave.

```
