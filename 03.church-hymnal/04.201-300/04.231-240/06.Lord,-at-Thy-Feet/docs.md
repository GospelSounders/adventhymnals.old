## 236. LORD, AT THY FEET

```txt
1.
Lord! at thy feet we humbly lie, 
And knock at mercy's door; 
With heavy heart and downcast eye 
Thy favor we implore. 

2.
'Tis mercy, we implore; 
We would thy pity move; 
Thy grace is an exhaustless store, 
And thou thyself art love. 

3.
O, for thine own, for Jesus' sake, 
Our numerous sins forgive! 
Thy grace our stony hearts can break; 
Heal us, and bid us live.

```
