## 239. LOW AT THY PIERCED FEET

```txt
1.
Low at thy pierced feet, 
Saviour of all, 
Helpless and sorrowful 
Prostrate I fall. 
O cast me not away, 
Forgive my sin this day, 
Forgive my sin, 
All, all my sin. 

2.
Sinful my life hath been, 
Unclean, unclean; 
All my iniquity 
Thine eye hath seen; 
Cleanse thou my soul today, 
Wash all my sin away 
In thine own blood, 
In thine own blood. 

3.
By all thy grief and pain, 
Forgive me now; 
Before thy cross in shame 
Lowly I bow. 
Lord, let that blood of thine 
Wash now this soul of mine; 
Wash now this soul, 
Wash now this soul. 

4.
Thou didst for me endure 
Dread Calvary; 
Sin's punishment and shame 
All, all for me. 
On thee my guilt was laid, 
By thee my dept was paid, 
To set me free, 
To set me free. 

5.
Lord, I accept thee now, 
Accept thou me; 
I have delayed too long, 
And grieved thee. 
By all thy love to me, 
I give myself to thee; 
Make me thine own, 
All, all thine own.
