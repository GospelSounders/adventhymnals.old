## 233. JESUS, TO THEE I NOW CAN FLY

```txt
1.
Jesus, to thee I now can fly, 
On whom my help is laid; 
Oppressed by sins, I lift my eye, 
And see the shadows fade. 

2.
Believing on my Lord, I find 
A sure and present aid; 
On thee alone my constant mind 
Be every moment stayed. 

3.
Whate'er in me seems wise, or good, 
Or strong, I here disclaim; 
I wash my garments in the blood 
Of the atoning Lamb. 

4.
Jesus, my Strength, my Life, my Rest, 
On thee will I depend, 
Till summoned to the marriage-feast, 
When faith in sight shall end.
