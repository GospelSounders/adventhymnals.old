## 265. MY LIFE FLOWS ON

```txt
1.
My life flows on in endless song; 
Amid earth's lamentation, 
I hear the sweet, though far-off hymn 
That hails a new creation; 
Through all the tumult and the strife 
I hear the music ringing; 
It finds an echo in my soul, 
How can I keep from singing? 

2.
What though my joys and comforts die, 
The Lord my Helper liveth! 
What though the darkness gather round: 
Songs in the night He giveth! 
No storm can shake my inmost calm 
While to that refuge clinging; 
Since God is Lord of heaven and earth, 
How can I keep from singing? 

3.
I lift mine eyes; the cloud grows thin; 
I see the blue above it; 
And day by day this pathway smooths 
Since first I learned to love it. 
The peace of God makes fresh my heart. 
A fountain ever spinging; 
All things are mine, since I am His 
How can I keep from singing?
