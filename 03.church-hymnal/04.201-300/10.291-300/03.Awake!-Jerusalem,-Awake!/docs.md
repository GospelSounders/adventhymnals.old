## 293. AWAKE! JERUSALEM, AWAKE!

```txt
1.
Awake! Jerusalem, awake! 
No longer in thy sins lie down; 
The garment of salvation take, 
Thy beauty and thy strength put on. 

2.
Shake off the dust that blinds thy sight, 
And hides the promise from thine eyes: 
Arise, and struggle into light; 
The great Deliverer calls, Arise! 

3.
Shake off the bands of sad despair; 
Zion, assert thy liberty; 
Look up, thy broken heart prepare, 
And God shall set the captive free. 

4.
Vessels of mercy, sons of grace, 
Be purged from every sinful slain; 
Be like your Lord, His word embrace, 
Nor bear His hallowed name in vain.
```
