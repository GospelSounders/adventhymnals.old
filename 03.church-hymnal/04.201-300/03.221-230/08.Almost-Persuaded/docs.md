## 228. ALMOST PERSUADED

```txt
1.
Almost persuaded now to believe; 
Almost persuaded Christ to receive. 
Seems now some soul to say, 
'Go, Spirit, go thy way, 
Some more convenient day 
On thee I'll call.' 

2.
Almost persuaded, come, come today; 
Almost persuaded, turn not away. 
Jesus invites you here, 
Angels are lingering near, 
Prayers rise from hearts so dear; 
O wanderer, come! 

3.
Almost persuaded, harvest is past; 
Almost persuaded, doom comes at last! 
'Almost' cannot avail; 
'Almost' is but to fail! 
Sad, sad that bitter wail, 
'Almost'but lost!'
