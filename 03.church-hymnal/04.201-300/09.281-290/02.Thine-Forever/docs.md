## 282. THINE FOREVER

```txt
1.
Thine forever! God of love, 
Hear us from Thy throne above; 
Thine forever may we be, 
Here and in eternity. 

2.
Thine forever! Lord of life, 
Shield us through our earthly strife; 
Thou the life, the truth, the way, 
Guide us to the realms of day. 

3.
Thine forever! Oh how blest 
They who find in Thee their rest! 
Saviour, Guardian, heavenly Friend, 
O defend us to the end. 

4.
Thine forever! Saviour, keep 
These Thy frail and trembling sheep; 
Safe alone beneath Thy care, 
Let us all Thy goodness share. 

5.
Thine forever! Thou our Guide, 
All our wants by Thee supplied, 
All our sins by Thee forgiven, 
Lead us, Lord, from earth to heaven.
