## 195. GREAT GOD, WHAT DO I SEE

```txt
1.
Great God, what do I see and hear! 
The end of things created! 
The Judge of man I see appear 
On clouds of glory seated; 
The trumpet sounds; the graves restore 
The dead which they contained before; 
Prepare, my soul, to meet Him. 

2.
The dead in Christ shall first arise, 
At the last trumpet's sounding' 
Caught up to meet Him in the skies, 
With joy their Lord surrounding; 
No gloomy fears their souls dismay, 
His presence sheds eternal day 
On those prepared to meet Him. 

3.
But sinners filled with guilty fears, 
Behold His wrath prevailing; 
For they shall rise, and find their tears 
And sighs are unavailing; 
The day of grace is past and gone 
Trembling they stand before the throne, 
All unprepared to meet Him. 

4.
Great God! what did I see and hear! 
The end of things created! 
The Judge of man I see apprear 
On clouds of glory seated; 
Beneath His cross I view the day 
When heaven and earth shall pass away, 
And thus prepare to meet Him.
