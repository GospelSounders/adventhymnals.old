## 110. ALL MY HEART THIS NIGHT REJOICES

```txt
1.
All my heart this night rejoices, 
As I hear, 
Far and near, 
Sweetest angel voices; 
"Christ is born," their choirs are singing, 
Till the air, 
Everywhere, 
Now with joy is ringing. 

2.
Hark! a voice from yonder manger, 
Soft and sweet, 
Doth entreat: 
"Flee from woe and danger; 
Brethren, come; from all that grieves you, 
You are freed; 
All you need 
I will surely give you." 

3.
Come, then, let us hasten yonder; 
Here let all, 
Great and small, 
Kneel in awe and wonder; 
Love Him who with love is yearning; 
Hail the star, 
That from far 
Bright with hope is burning!
