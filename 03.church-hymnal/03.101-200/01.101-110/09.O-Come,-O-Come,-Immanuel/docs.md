## 109. O COME, O COME, IMMANUEL

```txt
1.
O come, O come, Emmanuel,
And ransom captive Israel,
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.

Refrain:
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee,
O Israel.

2.
O come, Thou Wisdom from on high,
And order all things far and night;
To us the path of knowledge show,
And cause us in her ways to go.

Refrain:
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee,
O Israel.

3.
O come, Desire of nations, bind
All peoples in one heart and mind;
Bid envy, strife and quarrels cease;
Fill the whole world with heaven's peace.

Refrain:
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee,
O Israel.
