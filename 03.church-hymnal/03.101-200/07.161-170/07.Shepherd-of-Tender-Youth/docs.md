## 167. SHEPHERD OF TENDER YOUTH

```txt
1.
Shepherd of tender youth, 
Guiding in love and truth,
Through devious ways; 
Christ our triumphant King, 
We come Thy name to sing, 
Hither our children bring
To shout Thy praise.

2.
Thou are our holy Lord, 
The all subduing Word,
Healer of strife; 
Thou didst Thyself abase,
That from sin's deep disgrace
Thou mightest save our race,
And give us life.

3.
Thou are the great High Priest; 
Thou hast prepared the feast
Of heavenly love; 
While in our mortal pain
None call on Thee in vain;
Help Thou does not disdain,
Help from above.

4.
Ever be Thou our Guide,
Our Shepherd and our pride,
Our staff and song; 
Jesus, Thou Christ of God,
By Thy perennial word,
Lead us where Thou hast trod,
Make our faith strong.
