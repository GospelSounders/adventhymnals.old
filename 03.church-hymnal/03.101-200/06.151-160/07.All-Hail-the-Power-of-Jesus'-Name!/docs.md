## 157. ALL HAIL THE POWER OF JESUS' NAME!

```txt
1.
All hail the power of Jesus' name! 
Let angels prostrate fall; 
Bring forth the royal diadem, 
And crown Him Lord of all! 
Bring forth the royal diadem, 
And crown Him Lord of all. 

2.
Ye seed of Israel's chosen race, 
Ye ransomed from the fall, 
Hail Him who saves you by His grace, 
And crown Him Lord of all! 
Hail Him who saves you by His grace, 
And crown Him Lord of all. 

3.
Let every kindred, every tribe, 
On this terrestrial ball 
To Him all majesty ascribe, 
And crown Him Lord of all! 
To Him all majesty ascribe, 
And crown Him Lord of all. 

4.
Oh, that with yonder sacred throng 
We at His feet may fall, 
Join in the everlasting song, 
And crown Him Lord of all! 
Join in the everlasting song, 
And crown Him Lord of all.
