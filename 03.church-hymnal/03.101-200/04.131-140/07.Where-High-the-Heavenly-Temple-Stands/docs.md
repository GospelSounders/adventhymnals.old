## 137. WHERE HIGH THE HEAVENLY TEMPLE STANDS

```txt
1.
Where high the heavenly temple stands, 
The house of God not made with hands, 
A great High Priest our nature wears, 
The Guardian of mankind appears. 

2.
He, who for men their surety stood, 
And poured on earth his precious blood, 
Pursues in heaven His mighty plan, 
The Savior and the Friend of man. 

3.
In every pang that rends the heart 
The Man of Sorrows had a part; 
He sympathizes with our grief, 
And to the sufferer sends relief. 

4.
With boldness therefore at the throne 
Let us make all our sorrows known, 
And ask the aid of heavenly power, 
To help us in the evil hour.
