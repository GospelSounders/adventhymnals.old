## 178. IN THE SUN, AND MOON, AND STARS

```txt
1.
In the sun, and moon, and stars, 
Signs and wonders have appeared; 
Earth has groaned with bloody wars, 
And the hearts of men have feared. 

2.
Soon shall ocean's hoary deep, 
Tossed with stronger tempests, rise; 
Darker storms the mountain sweep, 
Fiercer lightning rend the skies. 

3.
Dread alarms shall shake the proud, 
Pale amazement, restless fear; 
And, amid the thunder-cloud, 
Shall the Judge of men appear. 

4.
But, though from His awful face, 
Heaven shall fade, and earth shall fly, 
Fear not, ye, His chosen race, 
Your redemption draweth nigh.
