## 392. UNSHAKEN AS THE SACRED HILLS

```txt
1.
Unshaken as the sacred hills, 
And fixed as mountains stand, 
Firm as a rock the soul shall rest 
That trusts th' Almighty hand. 

2.
Not walls nor hills could guard so well 
Fair Salem's happy ground 
As those eternal arms of love 
That every saint surround. 

3.
Do good, O Lord, do good to those 
Who cleave to Thee in heart, 
Who on Thy truth alone repose, 
Nor from Thy law depart.
```
