## 396. THY WAY, NOT MINE

```txt
1.
Thy way, not mine, O Lord, 
However dark it be; 
Lead me by Thine own hand, 
Choose out the path for me. 

2.
Smooth let it be or rough, 
It will be still the best; 
Winding or straight, it leads 
Right onward to Thy rest 

3.
I dare not choose my lot; 
I would not, if I might; 
Choose Thou for me, my God. 
So shall I walk arigh. 

4.
The kingdom that I seek 
Is Thine; so let the way 
That leads to it be Thine, 
Else I must surely stray. 

5.
Not mine, not mine the choice 
In things or great or small; 
Be Thou my guide, my strength, 
My wisdom, and my all.
```
