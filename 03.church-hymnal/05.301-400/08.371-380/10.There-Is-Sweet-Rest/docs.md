## 380. THERE IS SWEET REST

```txt
1.
There is sweet rest for feet now weary, 
In the rugged, upward way; 
There is a morn when midnight dreary 
Shall be lost in perfect day. 

2.
For that blest morn our hearts are longing, 
When shall end earth's night of woe; 
When, through those pearly portals thronging, 
Mortal cares we'll leave below. 

3.
Soon to that city, bright, eternal, 
Weary pilgrims all shall go; 
Soon we shall rest in pastures vernal, 
Where life's waters ceaseless flow. 

4.
Father above, in mercy guide us 
To those mansions of the blest; 
Safe in the Rock of Ages hide us 
Till we gain our final rest.
