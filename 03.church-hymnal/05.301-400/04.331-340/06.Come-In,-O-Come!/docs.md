## 336. COME IN, O COME!

```txt
1.
Come in, O come! the door stands open now; 
I knew Thy voice; Lord Jesus, it was Thou; 
The sun has set long since; the storms begin; 
'Tis time for Thee, my Saviour, O come in! 

2.
Alas, ill-ordered shows the dreary room; 
The household stuff lies heaped amidst the gloom, 
The table empty stands, the couch undressed; 
Ah, what a welcome for th' Eternal Guest! 

3.
Yet welcome and tonight; this doleful scene 
Is e'en itself my cause to hail Thee in; 
This dark confusion e'en at once demands 
Thine own bright presence, Lord, and ordering hands. 

4.
I seek no more to alter things, or mend, 
Before the coming of so great a Friend; 
All were at best unseemly; and 'twere ill 
Beyond all else to keep Thee waiting still 

5.
Come, not to find, but make this troubled heart 
A dwelling worthy of Thee as Thou art; 
To chase the gloom, the terror, and the sin: 
Come, all Thyself, yea, come, Lord Jesus, in!
