## 339. WALK IN THE LIGHT

```txt
1.
Walk in the light! so shalt thou know 
That fellowship of love 
His Spirit only can bestow 
Who reigns in light above, 
Who reigns in light above. 

2.
Walk in the light! and thou shalt own 
Thy darkness passed away; 
Because that light on thee hath shone 
In which is perfect day, 
In which is perfect day. 

3.
Walk in the light! and e'en the tomb 
No fearful shade shall wear; 
Glory shall chase away its gloom, 
For Christ hath conquered there, 
For Christ hath conquered there. 

4.
Walk in the light! and thine shall be 
A path, though thorny, bright; 
For God, by grace, shall dwell in thee, 
And God Himself is light, 
And God Himself is light.
```
