## 332. MY HEART IS RESTING

```txt
1.
My heart is resting, O my God, 
I will give thanks and sing; 
My heart is at the secret source 
Of every precious thing. 

2.
I thirst for springs of heavenly life, 
And here an day they rise; 
I seek the treasure of Thy love, 
And close at hand it lies. 

3.
I have a heritage of joy, 
That yet I must not see; 
The hand that bled to make it mine 
Is keeping it for me. 

4.
There is a certainty of love 
That sets my heart at rest; 
A calm assurance for today, 
That to be poor is best. 

5.
A prayer, reposing on His truth, 
Who hath made all things mine, 
That draws my captive will to Him, 
And makes it one with Thine.
