## 303. DAUGHTER OF ZION

```txt
1.
Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness; 
Awake, for thy foes shall oppress thee no more, 
Bright, o'er thy hills, dawns the daystar of gladness, 
Arise for the night of thy sorrow is o'er. 
Daughter of Zion, awake from thy sadness; 
Awake, for thy foes shall oppress thee no more. 

2.
Strong were thy foes; but the arm that subdued them, 
And scattered their legions, was mightier far; 
They fled like the chaff from the scourge that pursued them; 
In vain were their steeds and their chariots of war. 
Strong were thy foes; but the arm that subdued them, 
And scattered their legions, was mightier far. 

3.
Daughter of Zion, the power that hath saved thee, 
Extolled with the harp and the timbrel shall be. 
Shout; for the foe is destroyed that enslaved thee, 
The oppressor is vanquished, and Zion is free 
Daughter of Zion, the power that hath saved thee, 
Extolled with the harp and the timbrel shall be.
