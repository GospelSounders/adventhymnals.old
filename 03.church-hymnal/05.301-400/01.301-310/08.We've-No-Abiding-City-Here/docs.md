## 308. WE'VE NO ABIDING CITY HERE

```txt
1.
Here We've no abiding city here; 
Sad truth, were this to be our home; 
But let this thought our spirits cheer, 
We seek a city yet to come, 
We seek a city yet to come. 

2.
We've no abiding city here, 
We seek a city out of sight; 
Zion its name'the Lord is there' 
It shines with everlasting light, 
It shines with everlasting light. 

3.
O sweet abode of peace and love, 
Where pilgrims, freed from toil, are blest! 
Had I the pinions of a dove, 
I'd fly to thee, and be at rest, 
I'd fly to thee, and be at rest. 

4.
But hush, my soul! nor dare repine; 
The time my God appoints is best; 
While here, to do His will be mine, 
And His to fix my time of rest, 
And His to fix my time of rest.
```
