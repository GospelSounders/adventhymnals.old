## 327. IN THE HOUR OF TRIAL

```txt
1.
In the hour of trial, Jesus, plead for me,
Lest by base denial I depart from Thee;
When Thou see'st me waver, With a look recall,
Nor, for fear or favor, Suffer me to fall.

2.
With forbidden pleasures Would this vain world charm;
Or its sordid treasures Spread to work me harm;
Bring to my remembrance Sad Gethsemane,
Or, in darker semblance, Cross-crowned Calvary.

3.
Should Thy mercy send me Sorrow, toil, and woe,
Or should pain attend me On my path below,
Grant that I may never Fail Thy hand to see;
Grant that I may ever Cast my care on Thee.
