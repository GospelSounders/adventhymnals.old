## 317. I LOVE TO STEAL AWHILE AWAY

```txt
1.
Away I love to steal awhile away 
From every cumbering care, 
And spend the hours of setting day 
In humble, grateful prayer. 

2.
I love in solitude to shed 
The penitential tear; 
And all His promises to plead, 
Where none but God can hear. 

3.
I love to think on mercies past, 
And future good implore; 
And all my cares and sorrows cast 
On Him whom I adore. 

4.
I love by faith to take a view 
Of brighter scenes to come; 
The prospect doth my strength renew 
While here away from home.
```
