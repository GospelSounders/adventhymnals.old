## 370. DAY IS DONE, GONE THE SUN

```txt
1.
Christ for the world we sing,
The world to Christ we bring,
With loving zeal;
The poor, and them that mourn,
The faint and overborne,
Sinsick and sorrow-worn,
Whom Christ doth heal.

2.
Christ for the world we sing,
The world to Christ we bring,
With fervent prayer;
The wayward and the lost,
By restless passions tossed,
Redeemed at countless cost,
From dark despair.

3.
Christ for the world we sing,
The world to Christ we bring,
With joyful song;
The newborn souls, whose days,
Reclaimed from error's ways,
Inspired with hope and praise,
To Christ belong.
