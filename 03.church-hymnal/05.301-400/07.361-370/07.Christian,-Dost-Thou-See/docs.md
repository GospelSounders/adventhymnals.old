## 367. CHRISTIAN, DOST THOU SEE?

```txt
1.
Christian, dost thou see them 
On the holy ground, 
How the powers of darkness 
Rage thy steps around? 
Christian, up and smite them, 
Counting gain but loss, 
In the strength God giveth, 
Soldier of the cross! 

2.
Christian, dost thou see them, 
How they work within, 
Striving, tempting, luring, 
Goading into sin? 
Christian, never tremble; 
Never be downcast; 
Gird thee for the battle, 
Watch and pray and fast. 

3.
Christian, dost thou see them, 
How they speak thee fair? 
"Always fast and vigil? 
Always watch and prayer?" 
Christian, answer boldly, 
"While I breathe I pray!" 
Peace shall follow battle, 
Night shall end in day. 

4.
Hear the words of Jesus: 
"O My servant true; 
Thou art very weary 
I was weary too; 
But that toil shall make thee 
Someday all Mine own, 
And the end of sorrow 
Shall be near My throne." Amen.
