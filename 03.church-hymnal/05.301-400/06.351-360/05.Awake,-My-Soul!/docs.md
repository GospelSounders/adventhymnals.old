## 355. AWAKE, MY SOUL!

```txt
1.
Awake, my soul! stretch every nerve,
And press with vigor on;
A heavenly race demands thy zeal,
And an immortal crown.

2.
'Tis God's all animating voice
That calls thee from on high;
'Tis He whose hand presents the prize
To thine aspiring eye.

3.
A cloud of witnesses around
Hold thee in full survey;
Forget the steps already trod,
And onward urge thy way.

4.
Blest Savior, introduced by Thee,
Our race have we begun;
And, crowned with victory, at Thy feet
We'll lay our trophies down.
```
