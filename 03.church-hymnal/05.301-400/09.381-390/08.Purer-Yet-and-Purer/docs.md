## 388. PURER YET AND PURER

```txt
1.
Purer yet and purer 
I would be in mind, 
Dearer every and dearer 
Every duty find; 
Hoping still and trusting 
God without a fear, 
Patiently believing 
He will make all clear. 

2.
Calmer yet and calmer 
In the hours of pain, 
Surer yet and surer 
Peace at last to gain; 
Suffer still and doing, 
To His will resigned, 
And to God subduing 
Heart and will and mind. 

3.
Higher yet and higher 
Out of clouds and night, 
Nearer yet and nearer 
Rising to the light-- 
Light serene and holy, 
Where my soul may rest, 
Purified and lowly, 
Sanctified and blest. 

4.
Swifter yet and swifter 
Ever onward run, 
Firmer yet and firmer 
Step as I go on; 
Oft these earnest longings 
Swell within my breast, 
Yet their inner meaning 
Ne'er can be expressed.
