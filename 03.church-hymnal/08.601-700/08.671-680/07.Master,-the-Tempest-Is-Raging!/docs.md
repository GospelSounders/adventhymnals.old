## 677. MASTER, THE TEMPEST IS RAGING!

```txt
1.
Master, the tempest is raging! 
The billows are tossing high! 
The sky is o'ershadowed with blackness; 
No shelter or help is nigh; 
Carest Thou not that we perish? 
How canst Thou lie asleep, 
When each moment so madly is threatening 
A grave in the angry deep? 

Refrain:
"The winds and the waves shall obey My will, 
Peace, be still! 
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea, 
Or demons, or men, or whatever it be, 
No water can swallow the ship where lies 
The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies; 
They all shall sweetly obey My will; 
Peace, be still! Peace, be still! 
They all shall sweetly obey My will; 
Peace, peace, be still!" 

2.
Master, with anguish of spirit 
I bow in my grief today; 
The depths of my sad heart are troubled; 
O, waken and save, I pray! 
Torrents of sin and of anguish 
Sweep o'er my sinking soul; 
And I perish! I perish I dear Master; 
O hasten, and take control. 

Refrain:
"The winds and the waves shall obey My will, 
Peace, be still! 
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea, 
Or demons, or men, or whatever it be, 
No water can swallow the ship where lies 
The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies; 
They all shall sweetly obey My will; 
Peace, be still! Peace, be still! 
They all shall sweetly obey My will; 
Peace, peace, be still!" 

3.
Master, the terror is over, 
The elements sweetly rest; 
Earth's sun in the calm lake is mirrored, 
And heaven's within my breast; 
Linger, 0 blessed Redeemer, 
Leave me alone no more; 
And with joy I shall make the blest harbor, 
And rest on the blissful shore.

Refrain:
"The winds and the waves shall obey My will, 
Peace, be still! 
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea, 
Or demons, or men, or whatever it be, 
No water can swallow the ship where lies 
The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies; 
They all shall sweetly obey My will; 
Peace, be still! Peace, be still! 
They all shall sweetly obey My will; 
Peace, peace, be still!"
