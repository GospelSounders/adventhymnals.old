## 676. JESUS, STILL LEAD ON

```txt
1.
Jesus, still lead on, 
Till our rest be won, 
And, although the way be cheerless, 
We will follow, calm and fearless; 
Guide us by Thy hand 
To our fatherland. 

2.
If the way be drear, 
If the foe be near, 
Let not faithless fears o'ertake us, 
Let not faith and hope forsake us; 
For, through many a foe, 
To our home we go. 

3.
Jesus, still lead on, 
Till our rest be won; 
Heavenly Leader, still direct us, 
Still support, console, protect us, 
Till we safely stand 
In our fatherland.
```
