## 657. ON THE SHORE BEYOND THE SEA

```txt
1.
On the shore beyond the sea, 
Where the fields are bright and fair, 
There's a call, a plaintive plea, 
I must hasten to be there. 

Refrain:
Let me go, I cannot stay, 
'Tis the Master calling me; 
Let me go, I must obey; 
Native land, farewell to thee. 

2.
Hark! I hear the Master say, 
"Up, ye reapers! why so slow?" 
To the vineyard, far away, 
Earthly kindred, let me go. 

Refrain:
Let me go, I cannot stay, 
'Tis the Master calling me; 
Let me go, I must obey; 
Native land, farewell to thee. 

3.
Just beyond the rolling tide, 
The uplifted hand I see; 
Lo! the gates are open wide, 
And the lost are calling me. 

Refrain:
Let me go, I cannot stay, 
'Tis the Master calling me; 
Let me go, I must obey; 
Native land, farewell to thee. 

4.
Father, mother, darling child, 
I must bid you all adieu; 
Far across the waters wild, 
There's a work for me to do.

Refrain:
Let me go, I cannot stay, 
'Tis the Master calling me; 
Let me go, I must obey; 
Native land, farewell to thee.
