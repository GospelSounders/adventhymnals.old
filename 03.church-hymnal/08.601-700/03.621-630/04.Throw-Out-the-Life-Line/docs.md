## 624. THROW OUT THE LIFE LINE

```txt
1.
Throw out the life line across the dark wave, 
There is a brother whom someone should save; 
Somebody's brother! oh, who then will dare 
To throw out the life line, his peril to share? 

Refrain:
Throw out the life line! 
Throw out the life line! 
Someone is drifting away! 
Throw out the life line! 
Throw out the life line! 
Someone is sinking today. 

2.
Throw out the life line with hand quick and strong; 
Why do you tarry, why linger so long? 
See! he is sinking; oh, hasten today 
And out with the lifeboat! away, then, away! 

Refrain:
Throw out the life line! 
Throw out the life line! 
Someone is drifting away! 
Throw out the life line! 
Throw out the life line! 
Someone is sinking today. 

3.
Throw out the life line to danger fraught men, 
Sinking in anguish where you've never been; 
Winds of temptation and billows of woe 
Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow. 

Refrain:
Throw out the life line! 
Throw out the life line! 
Someone is drifting away! 
Throw out the life line! 
Throw out the life line! 
Someone is sinking today. 

4.
Soon will the season of rescue be o'er, 
Soon will they drift to eternity's shore; 
Haste, then, my brother, no time for delay, 
But throw out the life line and save them today.

Refrain:
Throw out the life line! 
Throw out the life line! 
Someone is drifting away! 
Throw out the life line! 
Throw out the life line! 
Someone is sinking today.
