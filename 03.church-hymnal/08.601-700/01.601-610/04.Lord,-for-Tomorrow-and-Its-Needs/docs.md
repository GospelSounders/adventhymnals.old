## 604. LORD, FOR TOMORROW AND ITS NEEDS

```txt
1.
Lord, for tomorrow and its needs 
I do not pray; 
Keep me, my God, from stain of sin 
Just for today. 
Help me to labor earnestly, 
And duly pray: 
Let me be kind in word and deed, 
Father, today. 

2.
Let me be slow to do my will, 
Prompt to obey; 
Help me to sacrifice myself, 
Father, today. 
Let me no wrong or idle word 
Unthinking say; 
Set Thou a seal upon my lips 
Through all today. 

3.
Let me in season, Lord, be grave, 
In season gay; 
Let me be faithful to Thy grace, 
Father, today. 
Lord, for tomorrow and its needs 
I do not pray: 
Still keep me, guide me, love me, Lord, 
Through each today.
```
