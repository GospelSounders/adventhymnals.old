## 635. REDEEMED! HOW I LOVE TO PROCLAIM IT!

```txt
1.
Redeemed! how I love to proclaim it! 
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; 
Redeemed through His infinite mercy, 
His child, and forever, I am. 

Refrain:
Redeemed, redeemed, 
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; 
Redeemed, redeemed, 
His child, and forever, I am. 

2.
Redeemed! and so happy in Jesus! 
No language my rapture can tell; 
I know that the light of His presence 
With me doth continually dwell. 

Refrain:
Redeemed, redeemed, 
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; 
Redeemed, redeemed, 
His child, and forever, I am. 

3.
I think of my blessed Redeemer, 
I think of Him all the day long; 
I sing, for I cannot be silent; 
His love is the theme of my song. 

Refrain:
Redeemed, redeemed, 
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; 
Redeemed, redeemed, 
His child, and forever, I am. 

4.
I know I shall see in His beauty 
The King in whose law I delight, 
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps, 
And giveth me songs in the night. 

Refrain:
Redeemed, redeemed, 
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; 
Redeemed, redeemed, 
His child, and forever, I am. 

5.
I know there's a crown that is waiting, 
In yonder bright mansion for me; 
And soon, with the spirits made perfect, 
At home with the Lord I shall be.

Refrain:
Redeemed, redeemed, 
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb; 
Redeemed, redeemed, 
His child, and forever, I am.
