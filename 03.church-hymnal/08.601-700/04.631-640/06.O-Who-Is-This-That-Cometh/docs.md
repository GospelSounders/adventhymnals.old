## 636. O WHO IS THIS THAT COMETH?

```txt
1.
O who is this that cometh 
From Edom's crimson plain. 
With wounded side, with garments dyed? 
O tell me now Thy name. 
"I that saw thy soul's distress, 
A ransom gave; 
I that speak in rightiousness, 
Mighty to save." 

2.
O why is Thine apparel, 
With reeking gore all dyed, 
Like them that tread the wine press red? 
O why this bloody tide? 
"I the wine press trod alone, 
'Neath darkening skies; 
Of the people there was none 
Mighty to save." 

3.
O bleeding Lamb, my Saviour! 
How could'st Thou bear this shame? 
With mercy fraught, mine own arm brought 
Salvation in My name; 
I the bloody fight have won, 
Conquered the grave, 
Now the year of joy has come' 
Mighty to save."
```
