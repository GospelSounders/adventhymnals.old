What a wonderful Saviour! 
That reconciled my soul to God; 
What a wonderful Saviour!

What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Jesus!

What a wonderful Saviour! 
And now He reigns and rules therein; 
What a wonderful Saviour!

He walks beside me in the way, 
What a wonderful Saviour! 
And keeps me faithful day by day; 
What a wonderful Saviour!

What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Jesus!

What a wonderful Saviour! 
And triumph in each trying hour; 
What a wonderful Saviour!

To Him I've given all my heart, 
What a wonderful Saviour! 
The world shall never share a part; 
What a wonderful Saviour!
