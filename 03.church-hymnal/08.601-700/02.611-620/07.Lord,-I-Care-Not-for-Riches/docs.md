## 617. LORD, I CARE NOT FOR RICHES

```txt
1.
Lord, I care not for riches, 
Neither silver nor gold; 
I would make sure of heaven, 
I would enter the fold; 
I n the book of Thy kingdom, 
With its pages so fair, 
Tell me, Jesus, my Saviour, 
Is my name written there? 

Refrain:
Is my name written there, 
On the page white and fair? 
In the book of Thy kingdom, 
Is my name written there? 

2.
Lord, my sins they are many, 
Like the sands of the sea, 
But Thy blood, O my Saviour, 
Is sufficient for me; 
For Thy promise is written 
In bright letters that glow, 
"Though Your sins be as scarlet, 
I will make them like snow." 

Refrain:
Is my name written there, 
On the page white and fair? 
In the book of Thy kingdom, 
Is my name written there? 

3.
Oh, that beautiful city, 
With its mansions of light, 
With its glorified beings 
In pure garments of white; 
Where no evil thing cometh 
To despoil what is fair, 
Where the angels are watching' 
Is my name written there?

Refrain:
Is my name written there, 
On the page white and fair? 
In the book of Thy kingdom, 
Is my name written there?
