## 458. HOW SWEET UPON THIS SACRED DAY

```txt
1.
How sweet upon this sacred day, 
The best of all the seven, 
To cast our earthly thoughts away, 
And think of God and heaven! 

2.
How sweet to be allowed to pray, 
Our sins may be forgiven! 
With filial confidence to say, 
"Father, who art in heaven!" 

3.
How sweet the words of peace to hear 
From Him to whom 'tis given 
To wake the penitential tear, 
And lead the way to heaven! 

4.
And if, to make our sins depart, 
In vain the will has striven, 
He who regards the inmost heart 
Will send his grace from heaven.
```
