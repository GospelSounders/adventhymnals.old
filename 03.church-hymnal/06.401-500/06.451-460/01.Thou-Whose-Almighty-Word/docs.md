## 451. THOU WHOSE ALMIGHTY WORD

```txt
1.
Thou whose almighty word 
Chaos and darkness heard, 
And took their flight, 
Hear us, we humbly pray, 
And where the gospel's day 
Sheds not its glorious ray, 
Let there be light! 

2.
Thou who didst come to bring 
On Thy redeeming wing 
Healing and sight, 
Health to the sick in mind, 
Sight to the inly blind, 
O now to all mankind, 
Let there be light! 

3.
Spirit of truth and love, 
Lifegiving, holy Dove, 
Speed forth Thy flight; 
Move o'er the water's face, 
Bearing the lamp of grace, 
And, in earth's darkest place, 
Let there be light!
```
