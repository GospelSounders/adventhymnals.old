## 427. SAVIOUR, WHILE MY HEART IS TENDER

```txt
1.
Saviour, while my heart is tender, 
I would yield that heart to Thee; 
All my powers to Thee surrender, 
Thine, and only Thine, to be. 

2.
Take me now, Lord Jesus, take me, 
Let my youthful heart be Thine; 
Thy devoted servant make me, 
Fill my soul with love divine. 

3.
Send me, Lord, where Thou wilt send me, 
Only do Thou guide my way; 
May Thy grace through life attend me; 
Gladly then shall I obey.
```
