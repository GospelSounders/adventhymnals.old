## 429. JESUS,  I WILL FOLLOW THEE

```txt
1.
Jesus, I will follow Thee, 
For I hear Thee calling me; 
Loving, trusting, glad I come, 
To let Thee lead me home. 

Refrain:
I will follow Thee, 
I will follow Thee, 
I will follow Thee, 
Wherever Thou dost lead. 

2.
Little eyes might lose the way, 
Little feet might go astray; 
I might weak and weary be, 
But Thou art strong for me. 

Refrain:
I will follow Thee, 
I will follow Thee, 
I will follow Thee, 
Wherever Thou dost lead. 

3.
Grief and want may be my foes, 
Foolish sins my way oppose; 
Full of courage I will be, 
Whene'er I follow Thee.

Refrain:
I will follow Thee, 
I will follow Thee, 
I will follow Thee, 
Wherever Thou dost lead.
