## 499. SOUND THE BATTLE CRY

```txt
1.
Sound the battle cry,
See! the foe is nigh;
Raise the standard high
For the Lord;
Gird your armor on,
Stand firm, every one,
Rest your cause upon His holy word.
CHORUS:
Rouse, then soldiers!
Rally round the banner!
Ready, steady, pass the word along;
Onward, forward, shout aloud hosanna!
Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.

2.
Strong to meet the foe,
Marching on we go,
While our cause we know
Must prevail;
Shield and banner bright,
Gleaming in the light,
Battling for the right,
We ne'er can fail.

3.
O Thou God of all,
Hear us when we call,
Help us, one and all,
By Thy grace;
When the battle�s done,
And the victory won,
May we wear the crown
Before Thy face.
```
