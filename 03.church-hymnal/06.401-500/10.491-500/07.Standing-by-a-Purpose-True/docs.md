## 497. STANDING BY A PURPOSE TRUE

```txt
1.
 Standing by a purpose true, 
Heeding God's command, 
Honor them, the faithful few, 
All hail to Daniel's band! 

Refrain:
Dare to be a Daniel, 
Dare to stand alone! 
Dare to have a purpose firm! 
Dare to make it known! 

2.
Many mighty men are lost, 
Daring not to stand, 
Who for God had been a host 
By joining Daniel's band! 

Refrain:
Dare to be a Daniel, 
Dare to stand alone! 
Dare to have a purpose firm! 
Dare to make it known! 

3.
Many giants great and tall, 
Stalking through the land, 
Headlong to the earth would fall 
If met by Daniel's band! 

Refrain:
Dare to be a Daniel, 
Dare to stand alone! 
Dare to have a purpose firm! 
Dare to make it known! 

4.
Hold the temperance banner high! 
On to victory grand! 
Satan and his host defy, 
And shout for Daniel's band!

Refrain:
Dare to be a Daniel, 
Dare to stand alone! 
Dare to have a purpose firm! 
Dare to make it known!
