## 407. LORD, SPEAK TO ME

```txt
1.
Lord, speak to me, that I may speak 
In living echoes of Thy tone; 
As Thou has sought, so let me seek 
Thine erring children lost and lone. 

2.
O lead me, Lord, that I may lead 
The wandering and the wavering feet;
O feed me, Lord, that I may feed
Thy hungering ones with manna sweet.

3.
O strengthen me, that while I stand 
Firm on the rock, and strong in Thee, 
I may stretch out a loving land 
To wrestlers with the troubled sea. 
```
