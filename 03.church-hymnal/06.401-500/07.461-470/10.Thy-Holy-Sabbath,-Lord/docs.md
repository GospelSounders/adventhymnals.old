## 470. THY HOLY SABBATH, LORD

```txt
1.
Thy holy Sabbath, Lord, 
Thy people hail with joy; 
And while we wait to hear Thy word, 
Let praise our hearts employ. 

2.
With sweet delight the day 
That Thou hast called Thine own 
We hail, and all our homage pay 
To Thine exalted throne. 

3.
O may Thy saints be blessed! 
Assist us while we pray; 
May we enjoy a holy rest, 
And keep the sacred day. 

4.
When Sabbaths here shall end, 
And from these courts we move, 
May we an endless Sabbath spend 
In heavenly courts above.
