## 419. IN OUR HEARTS CELESTIAL VOICES

```txt
1.
In our hearts celestial voices 
Softly say: 
"Day is passing, night is coming; 
Kneel and pray," 

2.
Father, we obey the summons; 
Hear Our cry; 
Pity us and help our weakness, 
Thou Most High. 

3.
For the joys that most we cherish 
Praised be Thou! 
Good and gentle art Thou ever; 
Hear us now. 

4.
Coming morrows we may never 
Live to see; 
All we ask Thee is to keep us, 
Safe with Thee. 

5.
We are only little children 
Kneeling here, 
And we want our loving Father 
Always near. 

6.
Take us in Thy arms and keep us 
As Thine own; 
Gather us like little sunbeams 
Round Thy throne.
