## 443. WORKMAN OF GOD

```txt
1.
Workman of God, O lose not heart, 
But learn what God is like; 
And on the darkest battlefield 
Thou shalt know where to strike. 

2.
Thrice blest is he to whom is given 
The instinct that can tell 
That God is on the field, when He 
Is most invisible. 

3.
Blest, too, is he who can divine 
Where truth and justice lie, 
And dares to take the side that seems 
Wrong to man's blinded eye. 

4.
Then learn to scorn the praise of men, 
And learn to lose with God; 
For Jesus won the world through shame, 
And beckons thee His road. 

5.
For right is right, since God is God, 
And right the day must win; 
To doubt would be disloyalty, 
To falter would be sin.
