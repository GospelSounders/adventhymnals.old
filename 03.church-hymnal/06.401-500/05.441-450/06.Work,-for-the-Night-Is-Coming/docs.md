## 446. WORK, FOR THE NIGHT IS COMING

```txt
1.
Work for the night is coming, 
Work through the morning hours; 
Work while the dew is sparkling; 
Work 'mid springing flowers; 
Work while the day grows brighter, 
Work in the glowing sun; 
Work for the night is coming, 
When man's work is done. 

2.
Work for the night is coming, 
Work through the sunny noon; 
Fill brightest hours with labor, 
Rest comes sure and soon. 
Give every flying minute 
Something to keep in store; 
Work for the night is coming, 
When man works no more. 

3.
Work for the night is coming, 
Under the sunset skies; 
While their bright tints are glowing, 
Work for daylight flies. 
Work till the last beam fadeth, 
Fadeth to shine no more; 
Work while the night is darkening, 
When man's work is o'er.
