## 487. CHRIST IS MADE THE SURE FOUNDATION

```txt
1.
Christ is made the sure foundation,
Christ the head and cornerstone,
chosen of the Lord, and precious,
binding all the Church in one;
holy Zion's help for ever,
and her confidence alone.

2.
All that dedicated city,
dearly loved of God on high,
in exultant jubilation
pours perpetual melody;
God the One in Three adoring
in glad hymns eternally.

3.
To this temple, where we call thee,
come, O Lord of Hosts, today;
with thy wonted loving-kindness
hear thy servants as they pray,
and thy fullest benediction
shed within its walls alway.

4.
Here vouchsafe to all thy servants
what they ask of thee of gain;
what they gain from thee, for ever
with the bless'd to retain,
and hereafter in thy glory
evermore with thee to reign.

5.
Laud and honor to the Father,
laud and honor to the Son,
laud and honor to the Spirit,
ever Three, and ever One,
con-substantial, co-eternal,
while unending ages run.
