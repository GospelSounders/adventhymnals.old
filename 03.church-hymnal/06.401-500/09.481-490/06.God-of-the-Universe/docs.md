## 486. GOD OF THE UNIVERSE

```txt
1.
God of the universe, to Thee 
These sacred walls we rear; 
And now, with songs and bended knee, 
Invoke Thy presence here. 

2.
Here let Thy love, Thy presence, dwell; 
Thy glory here make known; 
Thy people's home, 0 come and fill, 
And seal it as Thine own. 

3.
When sad with care, by sin oppressed, 
Here may the burdened soul 
Beneath Thy sheltering wing find rest; 
Here make the wounded whole. 

4.
And when the last long Sabbath morn 
Upon the just shall rise, 
May all who own Thee here, be borne 
To mansions in the skies.
```
