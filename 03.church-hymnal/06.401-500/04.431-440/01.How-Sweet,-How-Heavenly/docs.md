## 431. HOW SWEET, HOW HEAVENLY

```txt
1.
How sweet, how heavenly is the sight 
When those who love the Lord 
In one another's peace delight, 
And thus fulfill His word. 

2.
When each can feel his brother's sigh, 
And with him bear a part; 
When sorrow flows from eye to eye, 
And joy from heart to heart. 

3.
When free from envy, scorn, and pride, 
Our wishes all above, 
Each can his brother's failings hide, 
And show a brother's love. 

4.
When love, in one delightful stream, 
Through every bosom flows; 
And union sweet, and dear esteem, 
In every action glows. 

5.
Love is the golden chain that binds 
The happy souls above, 
And he's an heir of heaven who finds 
His bosom glow with love.
