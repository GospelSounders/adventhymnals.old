## 439. WITH WILLING HEARTS WE TREAD

```txt
1.
With willing hearts we tread 
The path the Saviour trod; 
We love th'example of our head, 
The glorious Lamb of God. 

2.
On Thee, on Thee alone, 
Our hope and faith rely, 
O Thou who wilt for sin atone, 
Who didst for sinners die! 

3.
We trust Thy sacrifice, 
To Thy dear cross we flee; 
O may we die to sin, and rise 
To life and bliss in Thee.
```
