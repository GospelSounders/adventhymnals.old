## 82. BENEATH THY WING

```txt
1.
Beneath Thy wing, O God, I rest, 
Under Thy shadow safely lie, 
By Thine own strength in peace possest, 
While dreaded evils pass me by. 

2.
With strong desire, I here can stay 
To see Thy love its work complete; 
Here can I wait a long delay, 
Reposing at my Saviour's feet. 

3.
My place of lowly service, too, 
Beneath that sheltering wing I see; 
For all the work I have to do, 
Is done through strengthening trust in Thee. 

4.
In faith and patience is repose, 
In faith and rest my strength shall be; 
And, when Thy joy the Church o'erflows, 
I know that it will visit me.
