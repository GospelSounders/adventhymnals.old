## 100. TO US A CHILD OF HOPE IS BORN

```txt
1.
To us a Child of hope is born; 
To us a Son is given; 
Him shall the tribes of earth obey, 
Him all the hosts of heaven, 
Him all the hosts of heaven. 

2.
His Name shall be the Prince of peace, 
Forevermore adorned, 
The Wonderful, the Counselor, 
The great and mighty Lord! 
The great and mighty Lord! 

3.
His power, increasing, still shall spread, 
His reign no end shall know; 
Justice shall guard His throne above, 
And peace abound below, 
And peace abound below.

```
