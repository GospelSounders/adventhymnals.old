## 79. ERE MOUNATINS REARED THEIR FORMS SUBLIME

```txt
1.
Ere mountains reared their forms sublime, 
Or heaven and earth in order stood, 
Before the birth of ancient time, 
From everlasting Thou art God. 

2.
A thousand years are in their flight, 
With Thee but as a fleeting day; 
Past, present, future, to Thy sight 
At once their various scenes display. 

3.
But our brief life's a shadowy dream, 
A passing thought that soon is o'er, 
That fades with morning's earliest beam, 
And fills the musing mind no more. 

4.
To us, O Lord, the wisdom give 
Each passing moment so to spend, 
That we at length with Thee may live 
Where life and bliss shall never end.
