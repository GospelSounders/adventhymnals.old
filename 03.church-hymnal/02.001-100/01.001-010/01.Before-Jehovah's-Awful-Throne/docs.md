## 1. BEFORE JEHOVAH'S AWFUL THRONE

```txt
1.
Before Jehovah's awful throne, 
Ye nations, bow with sacred joy; 
Know that the Lord is God alone; 
He can create, and He destroy. 

2.
His sovereign power, without our aid, 
Made us of clay, and formed us men; 
And when like wandering sheep we strayed, 
He brought us to His fold again.

3.
We'll crowd His gates with thankful songs, 
High as the heavens our voices raise; 
And earth, with her ten thousand tongues, 
Shall fill His courts with sounding praise. 

4.
Wide as the world is His command, 
Vast as Eternity His love; 
Firm as a rock His truth shall stand, 
When rolling years shall cease to move.
