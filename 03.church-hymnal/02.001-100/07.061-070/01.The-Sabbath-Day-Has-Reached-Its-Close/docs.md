## 61. THE SABBATH DAY HAS REACHED ITS CLOSE

```txt
1.
The Sabbath day has reached its close, 
Yet, Saviour, ere I seek repose, 
Grant me the peace Thy love bestows; 
Smile on my evening hour. 

2.
Weary I come to Thee for rest; 
Hallow and calm my troubled breast; 
Grant me Thy Spirit for my guest; 
Smile on my evening hour. 

3.
Let not the gospel seed remain 
Unfruitful, or be sown in vain; 
Let heavenly dews descend like rain; 
Smile on my evening hour. 

4.
O Jesus, Lord enthroned on high, 
Thou hearest the contrite spirit's sigh; 
Look down on me with pitying eye; 
Smile on my evening hour. 

5.
My only intercessor Thou, 
Mingle Thy fragrant incense now 
With every prayer and every vow; 
Smile on my evening hour. 

6.
And, oh, when time's short course shall end, 
And death's dark shades around impend, 
My God, my everlasting Friend, 
Smile on my evening hour.
