## 60. O BLESSED HOUR

```txt
1.
O blessed hour, when evening comes, 
And calls us to our place of prayer ! 
with joyful heart our feet we turn 
To meet Thee and Thy children there. 

2.
With one accord we gather here, 
Our wants make known, our sins confess; 
Dear Saviour, wilt Thou now appear, 
And bless as only Thou canst bless. 

3.
Our faith increase, our fears remove; 
Make strong the weak, the helpless raise; 
May every heart now feel Thy love, 
And every tongue speak forth Thy praise. 

4.
No want have we Thou canst not fill, 
No need but Thou canst fully meet; 
May we obey Thy gracious will, 
And find our lives in Thee complete.
