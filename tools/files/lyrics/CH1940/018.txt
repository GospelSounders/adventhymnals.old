1O for a heart to praise my God!
A heart from sin set free,
A heart that always feels Thy blood,
So freely shed for me.
2A heart resigned, submissive, meek,
My dear Redeamer's throne,
Where only Christ is heard to speak,
So freely shed for me.
3A heart in every throught renewed,
And full of love divine,
Perfect, and right, and pure, and good,
A copy, Lord of Thine.
4.
Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
Come quickly from above;
Write Thy new name upon my heart,
Thy new, best name of Love.
