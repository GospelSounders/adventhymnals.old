1.
Hail the day that sees Him rise,
And ascend His native skies,
Christ, awhile to mortals given,
Enters now the gates of heaven.
2.
There the glorious triumph waits,
Lift your heads, eternal gates,
Christ hath vanquished death and sin;
Take the King of glory in,
3.
See, the heaven its Lord receives!
Yet He loves the earth He leaves;
Though returning to His throne,
Still He calls mankind His own.
4.
See, He lifts His hands above!
See, He shows the prints of love!
Hark! His gracious lips bestow,
Blessings on His church below.
5.
Saviour, parted from our sight,
High above yon azure height,
Grant our hearts may thither rise,
Following Thee beyond the skies.
