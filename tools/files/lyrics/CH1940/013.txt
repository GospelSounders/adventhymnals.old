1.
All people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
Him serve with fear, His praise forth tell;
Come ye before Him and rejoice.
2.
The Lord ye know is God indeed;
Without our aid He did us make;
We are His folk, He doth us feed;
And for His sheep He doth us take.
3O enter, then, His gates with praise,
Approach with joy his courts unto;
Praise, laud, and bless His Name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
4.
For why? the Lord our God is good,
His mercy is forever sure;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.
