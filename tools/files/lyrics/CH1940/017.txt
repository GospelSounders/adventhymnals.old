1.
Rejoice, ye pure in heart,
Rejoice, give thanks and sing;
Your festal banner wave on high,
The Cross of Christ your King.
RefrainRejoice, rejoice,
Rejoice, give thanks and sing.
2.
Bright youth and snow-crowned age,
Strong men and maidens meek;
Raise high your free, exulting song,
God's wondrous praises speak.
3.
With all the angel choirs,
With all the saints on earth,
Pour out the strains of joy and bliss,
True rapture, noblest mirth.
4.
Yes, on through life's path,
Still chanting as ye go;
From youth to age, by night and day,
In gladness and in woe.
5.
Then on, ye pure in heart,
Rejoice, give thanks, and sing;
Your glorious banner wave on high,
The Cross of Christ your King.
