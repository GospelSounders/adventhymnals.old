1.
Come, ye faithful, raise the strain
Of triumphant gladness;
God has brought His people forth
Into joy from sadness.
Now rejoice, Jerusalem,
And with true affection
Welcome in unwearied strains
Jesus' resurrection.
2'Tis the spring of souls today;
Christ has burst His prison;
From the frost and gloom of death
light and life have risen.
All the winter of our sins,
Long and dark, is flying
From His ligth, to whom we give
Thanks and praise undying.
3Alleluia! now we cry
To our King immortal,
Who, triumphant, burst the bars
Of the tomb's dark portal;
Alleluia! with the Son,
God the Father praising;
Alleluia! yet again
To the Spirit raising.
