1O come, O come, Immanuel,
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.
RefrainRejoice! Rejoice!
Immanuel shall come to thee,
O Israel!
2O come, Thou Wisdom from on high,
And order all things, far and night;
To us the path of knowledge show,
And cause us in her ways to go.
3O come, Desire of nations, bind
All people in one the heart and mind;
Bid envy, strife, and quarrels cease;
Fill the whole world with heaven's peace.
