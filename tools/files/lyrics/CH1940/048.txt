1.
Softly now the light of day
Fades upon our sight away:
Free from care, from labour free,
Lord, we would commune with Thee.
2.
Thou, whose all-pervading eye
Nought escapes, without, within,
Pardon each infirmity,
Open fault, and secret sin.
3.
Soon from us the light of day
Shall forever pass away;
Then, from sin and sorrow free,
Take us, Lord, to dwell with Thee.
