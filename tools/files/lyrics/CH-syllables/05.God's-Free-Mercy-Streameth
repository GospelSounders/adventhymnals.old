God's free mercy streameth  Over all the world,  And His banner gleameth,  By His church unfurled;  Broad and deep and glorious,  As the heaven above,  Shines in might victorious  His eternal love.","2. Summer suns are glowing  Over land and sea;  Happy light is flowing,  Bountiful and free;  Everything rejoices  In the mellow rays;  Earth's ten thousand voices  Swell the psalm of praise.","3. Lord, upon our blindness  Thy pure radiance pour;  For Thy lovingkindness  We would love Thee more;  And when clouds are drifting  Dark across the sky,  Then, the veil uplifting,  Father, be Thou nigh.","4.
