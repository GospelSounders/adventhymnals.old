## 29. RING THE BELLS OF HEAVEN

```txt
1.
Ring the bells of heaven!  there is joy today,
For a soul, returning from the wild;
See!  the Father meets him out upon the way,
Welcoming His weary, wand'ring child.

Chorus:
Glory!  glory!  how the angels sing;
Glory!  glory!  how the loud harps ring;
'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea,
Pealing forth the anthem of the free.

2.
Ring the bells of heaven!  there is joy today,
For the wanderer now is reconciled;
Yes, a soul is rescued from his sinful way,
And is born a new a ransomed child. 

Chorus:
Glory!  glory!  how the angels sing;
Glory!  glory!  how the loud harps ring;
'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea,
Pealing forth the anthem of the free.


3.
Ring the bells of heaven!  spread the feast today,
Angels, swell the glad triumphant strain.
Tell the joyful tidings!  bear it far away!
For a precious soul is born again. 

Chorus:
Glory!  glory!  how the angels sing;
Glory!  glory!  how the loud harps ring;
'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea,
Pealing forth the anthem of the free.
