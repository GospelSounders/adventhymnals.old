## 67. DARE TO DO RIGHT

```txt
1.
Dare to do right, dare to be true!
You have a work that no other can do;
Do it so bravely, so kindly, so well,
Angels will hasten the story to tell;
Angels will hasten the story to tell.

Chorus:
Dare to do right,
Dare to be true,
Dare!  dare!  dare to be true!

2.
Dare to do right, dare to be true!
Other men's failures can never save you;
Stand by your conscience, your honor, your faith;
Stand like a hero and battle till death;
Angels will hasten the story to tell. 

Chorus:
Dare to do right,
Dare to be true,
Dare!  dare!  dare to be true!


3.
Dare to do right, dare to be true!
God who created you cares for you too;
Treasures the tears that his striving ones shed,
Counts and protects ev'ry hair of your head;
Angels will hasten the story to tell. 

Chorus:
Dare to do right,
Dare to be true,
Dare!  dare!  dare to be true!


4.
Dare to do right, dare to be true!
Keep the great Judgment day always in view;
Look at your work as you'll look at it then
Scann'd by Jehovah, and angels, and men;
Angles will hasten the story to tell. 

Chorus:
Dare to do right,
Dare to be true,
Dare!  dare!  dare to be true!


5.
Dare to do right, dare to be true!
Jesus, your Saviour, will carry you through;
City, and mansion, and throne, all in sight,
Can you not dare to be true and do right?  
Angels will hasten the story to tell. 

Chorus:
Dare to do right,
Dare to be true,
Dare!  dare!  dare to be true!
