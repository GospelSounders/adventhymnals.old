## 96. WHAT HAST THOU DONE?

```txt
1.
I gave my life for Thee,
My precious blood I shed,
That Thou might'st ransom'd be,
And quicken'd from the dead,
I gave, I gave my life for Thee,
What has thou giv'n for me?
I gave, I gave my life for Thee,
What hast Thou giv'n for me?

2.
My Father's house of light,
My glory circled throne,
I left for earthly night,
For wand'rings sad and lone;
I left, I left it all for Thee,
Hast Thou left aught for me?
I left, I left it all for Thee,
Hast Thou left aught for me?

3.
I suffered much for Thee,
More than Thy tongue can tell,
Of bitt'rest agony,
To rescue Thee from hell;
I've borne, I've borne it all for Thee,
What hast Thou borne for me?
I've borne, I've borne it all for Thee,
What hast Thou borne for me?
