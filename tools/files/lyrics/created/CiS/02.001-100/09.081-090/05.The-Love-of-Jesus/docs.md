## 85. THE LOVE OF JESUS

```txt
1.
There is no love like the love of Jesus,
Never to fail or fall,
Till into the fold of the peace of God,
He has gathered us all.

Chorus:
Jesus' love, precious love,
Boundless and pure and free!
Oh, turn to that love, weary, wand'ring soul,
Jesus pleadeth for thee.

2.
There is no heart like the heart of Jesus,
Fill'd with a tender love;
No throb of woe that our hearts can know,
But He feeds it above. 

Chorus:
Jesus' love, precious love,
Boundless and pure and free!
Oh, turn to that love, weary, wand'ring soul,
Jesus pleadeth for thee.


3.
Oh, hearken now to the voice of Jesus;
Why will you longer roam:
There's peace and rest on His loving breast,
And a glad heav'nly home. 

Chorus:
Jesus' love, precious love,
Boundless and pure and free!
Oh, turn to that love, weary, wand'ring soul,
Jesus pleadeth for thee.
