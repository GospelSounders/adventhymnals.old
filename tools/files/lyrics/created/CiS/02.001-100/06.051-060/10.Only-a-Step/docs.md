## 60. ONLY A STEP

```txt
1.
Only a step to Jesus!
Then why not take it now?
Come, and thy sin confessing,
To Him thy Saviour bow.

Chorus:
Only a step, only a step;
Come, He waits for thee,
Come, and thy sin confessing,
Thou shalt receive a blessing;
Do not reject the mercy
He freely offers thee.

2.
Only a step to Jesus!
Believe and thou shalt live;
Lovingly now He's waiting,
And ready to forgive. 

Chorus:
Only a step, only a step;
Come, He waits for thee,
Come, and thy sin confessing,
Thou shalt receive a blessing;
Do not reject the mercy
He freely offers thee.


3.
Only a step to Jesus!
A step from sin to grace;
What has thy heart decided?
The moments fly apace. 

Chorus:
Only a step, only a step;
Come, He waits for thee,
Come, and thy sin confessing,
Thou shalt receive a blessing;
Do not reject the mercy
He freely offers thee.


4.
Only a step to Jesus!
O why not come, and say,
Gladly to thee, my Saviour,
I gave myself away. 

Chorus:
Only a step, only a step;
Come, He waits for thee,
Come, and thy sin confessing,
Thou shalt receive a blessing;
Do not reject the mercy
He freely offers thee.
