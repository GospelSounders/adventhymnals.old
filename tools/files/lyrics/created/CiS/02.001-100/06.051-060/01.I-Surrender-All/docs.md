## 51. I SURRENDER ALL

```txt
1.
All to Jesus I surrender,
All to Him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live;

Chorus:
I surrender all,
I surrender all;
All to Thee, my blessed Saviour,
I surrender all.

2.
All to Jesus I surrender,
Humbly at His feet I bow;
Worldly pleasures all forsaken,
Take me, Jesus, take me now; 

Chorus:
I surrender all,
I surrender all;
All to Thee, my blessed Saviour,
I surrender all.


3.
All to Jesus I surrender,
Make me, Saviour, wholly Thine;
Let me feel the Holy Spirit,
Truly know that Thou art mine; 

Chorus:
I surrender all,
I surrender all;
All to Thee, my blessed Saviour,
I surrender all.


4.
All to Jesus I surrender,
Now I feel the sacred flame,
O the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory to His name! 

Chorus:
I surrender all,
I surrender all;
All to Thee, my blessed Saviour,
I surrender all.
