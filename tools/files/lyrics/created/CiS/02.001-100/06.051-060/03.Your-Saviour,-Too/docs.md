## 53. YOUR SAVIOUR, TOO

```txt
1.
I have a Saviour, he's pleading in glory,
A dear, loving Saviour, tho' earth friends be few;
And now he is watching in tenderness o'er me,
And O that my Saviour were your Saviour too!

Chorus:
Your Saviour, too,
Your Saviour, too;
My Saviour bids me tell you,
He's your Saviour, too

2.
I have a Father to me he has given
A hope for eternity, blessed and true;
And soon will he call me to meet him in heaven,
But O that I might hear him welcome you too! 

Chorus:
Your Saviour, too,
Your Saviour, too;
My Saviour bids me tell you,
He's your Saviour, too


3.
A robe fair and spotless, resplendent in whiteness,
Is waiting in glory my wondering view;
And when I receive it all shining in brightness,
Dear friend, I would see you receiving one too! 

Chorus:
Your Saviour, too,
Your Saviour, too;
My Saviour bids me tell you,
He's your Saviour, too


4.
To me has been given a peace like a river
A peace that the friends of this world never knew;
And Christ is the Author, and Christ is the Giver,
And O that his peace might be given to you! 

Chorus:
Your Saviour, too,
Your Saviour, too;
My Saviour bids me tell you,
He's your Saviour, too


5.
When Jesus has found you, tell others the story,
That my loving Saviour is your Saviour too;
Then pray that your Saviour may bring them to glory,
And prayer will be answered 'twas answered for you! 

Chorus:
Your Saviour, too,
Your Saviour, too;
My Saviour bids me tell you,
He's your Saviour, too
