## 17. LORD, I'M COMING HOME

```txt
1.
I've wandered far away from God,
Now I'm coming home;
The paths of sin too long I've trod;
Lord, I'm coming home.

Chorus:
Coming home, coming home
Nevermore to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
Lord, I'm coming home.

2.
I've wasted many precious years
Now I'm coming home;
I now repent with bitter tears;
Lord, I'm coming home. 

Chorus:
Coming home, coming home
Nevermore to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
Lord, I'm coming home.


3.
I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord,
Now I'm coming home;
I'll trust Thy love, believe Thy word;
Lord, I'm coming home. 

Chorus:
Coming home, coming home
Nevermore to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
Lord, I'm coming home.


4.
My only hope, my only plea,
Now I'm coming home;
That Jesus died, and died for me;
Lord, I'm coming home. 

Chorus:
Coming home, coming home
Nevermore to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
Lord, I'm coming home.


5.
I need His cleansing blood I know,
Now I'm coming home;
O wash me whiter than the snow;
Lord' I'm coming home. 

Chorus:
Coming home, coming home
Nevermore to roam;
Open wide Thine arms of love;
Lord, I'm coming home.
