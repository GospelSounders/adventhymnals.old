Sing them over again to me,
Wonderful words of Life;
Let me more of their beauty see,
Wonderful words of Life;
Words of life and beauty, 
Teach me faith and duty,

Refrain:
Beautiful words, wonderful words,
Wonderful words of Life;
Beautiful words, wonderful words,
Wonderful words of Life.

Christ, the blessed One, gives to all,
Wonderful words of Life;
Sinner, list to the loving call,
Wonderful words of Life;
All so freely given,
Wooing as to heaven,

Beautiful words, wonderful words,
Wonderful words of Life;
Beautiful words, wonderful words,
Wonderful words of Life.

Sweetly echo the gospel call,
Wonderful words of Life;
Offer pardon and peace to all,
Wonderful words of Life;

Sanctify forever.

Beautiful words, wonderful words,
Wonderful words of Life;
Beautiful words, wonderful words,
