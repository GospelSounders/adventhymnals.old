## 896. AWAKE, YE SAINTS

```txt
1.
Awake, ye saints, and raise your eyes,
And raise your voices high;
Awake, and praise that sov'reign love
That shows salvation nigh;
Awake, and praise that sov'reign love
That shows salvation nigh.

2.
Swift on the wings of time it flies;
Each moment brings it near;
Then welcome each declining day,
Welcome each closing year;
Then welcome each declining day,
Welcome each closing year.

3.
Not many years their round shall run,
Not many mornings rise,
Ere all its glories stand revealed
To our admiring eyes;
Ere all its glories stand revealed
To our admiring eyes.
