## 873. THE BRIGHT FOREVER

```txt
1.
Breaking thro' the clouds that gather
O'er the Christian's natal skies,
Distant beams, like floods of glory,
Fill the soul with glad surprise;
And we almost hear the echo
Of the pure and holy throng,
In the bright, the bright forever,
In the summer land of song.

Chorus:
On the banks beyond the river
We shall meet, no more to sever;
In the bright, the bright forever,
In the summer land of song.

2.
Yet a little while we linger
Ere we reach our journey's end;
Yet a little while of labor,
Ere the ev'ning shades descend;
Then we'll lay us down to slumber,
But the night will soon be o'er;
In the bright, the bright forever,
We shall wake, to weep no more. 

Chorus:
On the banks beyond the river
We shall meet, no more to sever;
In the bright, the bright forever,
In the summer land of song.


3.
O the bliss of life eternal!
O the long unbroken rest!
In the golden fields of pleasure,
In the region of the blest;
But, to see our dear Redeemer,
And before his throne to fall,
There to hear his gracious welcome,
Will be sweeter far than all. 

Chorus:
On the banks beyond the river
We shall meet, no more to sever;
In the bright, the bright forever,
In the summer land of song.
