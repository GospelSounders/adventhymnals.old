## 877. JESUS COMES

```txt
1.
Watch, ye saints, with eyelids waking;
Lo!  the powers of heav'n are shaking;
Keep your lamps all trimm'd and burning,
Ready for your Lord's returning.

Refrain:
Lo!  he comes, lo!  Jesus comes;
Lo!  he comes, he comes, all glorious!
Jesus comes to reign victorious,
Lo!  he, comes, yes, Jesus comes.

2.
Lo!  the promise of your Saviour,
Pardoned sin and purchased favor,
Blood-wash'd robes and crowns of glory;
Haste to tell redemption's story. 

Refrain:
Lo!  he comes, lo!  Jesus comes;
Lo!  he comes, he comes, all glorious!
Jesus comes to reign victorious,
Lo!  he, comes, yes, Jesus comes.


3.
Kingdoms at their base are crumbling,
Hark!  his chariot wheels are rumbling;
Tell, O tell of grace abounding,
Whilst the seventh trump is sounding. 

Refrain:
Lo!  he comes, lo!  Jesus comes;
Lo!  he comes, he comes, all glorious!
Jesus comes to reign victorious,
Lo!  he, comes, yes, Jesus comes.


4.
Nations wane, tho' proud and stately;
Christ his kingdom hasteneth greatly;
Earth her latest pangs is summing;
Shout, ye saints, your Lord is coming. 

Refrain:
Lo!  he comes, lo!  Jesus comes;
Lo!  he comes, he comes, all glorious!
Jesus comes to reign victorious,
Lo!  he, comes, yes, Jesus comes.


5.
Sinners, come, while Christ is pleading;
Now for you he's interceding;
Haste, ere grace and time diminished
Shall proclaim the mystery finished. 

Refrain:
Lo!  he comes, lo!  Jesus comes;
Lo!  he comes, he comes, all glorious!
Jesus comes to reign victorious,
Lo!  he, comes, yes, Jesus comes.
