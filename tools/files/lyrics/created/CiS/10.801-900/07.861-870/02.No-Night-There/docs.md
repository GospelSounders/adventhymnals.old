## 862. NO NIGHT THERE

```txt
1.
In the land of fadeless day,
Lies "the city four-square,"
It shall never pass away,
And there is "no night there.

Chorus:
God shall "wipe away all tears;"
There's no death, no pain, nor fears;
And they count not time by years,
For there is "no night there."

2.
All the gates of pearl are made,
In "the city four-square,"
All the streets with gold are laid,
And there is "no night there." 

Chorus:
God shall "wipe away all tears;"
There's no death, no pain, nor fears;
And they count not time by years,
For there is "no night there."


3.
And the gates shall never close
To "the city four-square,"
There life's crystal river flows,
And there is "no night there." 

Chorus:
God shall "wipe away all tears;"
There's no death, no pain, nor fears;
And they count not time by years,
For there is "no night there."


4.
There they need no sunshine bright,
In "that city four-square,"
For the Lamb is all the light,
And there is "no night there." 

Chorus:
God shall "wipe away all tears;"
There's no death, no pain, nor fears;
And they count not time by years,
For there is "no night there."
