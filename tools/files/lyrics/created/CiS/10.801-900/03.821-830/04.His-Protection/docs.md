## 824. HIS PROTECTION

```txt
1.
Call Jehovah thy salvation,
Rest beneath th' Almighty's shade;
In His secret habitation
Dwell, and never be dismayed.

2.
Since, with pure and firm affection
Thou on God hast set thy love,
With the wings of His protection
He will shield thee from above.

3.
Thou shalt call on Him in trouble,
He will hearken, He will save;
For thy grief reward thee double,
Crown with life beyond the grave.  Amen.
```
