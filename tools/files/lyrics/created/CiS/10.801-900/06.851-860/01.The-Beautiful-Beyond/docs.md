## 851. THE BEAUTIFUL BEYOND

```txt
1.
Above the clouds that veil the blue
Beyond the stars that glimmer through,
There is a home unknown to care,
Its gates ajar invite me there.

Chorus:
O home of beauty, free from sorrow!
O everlasting glad tomorrow!

2.
The stream of life with ceaseless flow,
The holy joy that angels know,
The golden harp, the song divine,
The spotless robe Faith calls them mine. 

Chorus:
O home of beauty, free from sorrow!
O everlasting glad tomorrow!


3.
The flow'rs that sleep neath winter's snow.
The loves ones lost to us below,
The voices hush'd that used to sing,
We'll find them where Christ is King. 

Chorus:
O home of beauty, free from sorrow!
O everlasting glad tomorrow!

```
