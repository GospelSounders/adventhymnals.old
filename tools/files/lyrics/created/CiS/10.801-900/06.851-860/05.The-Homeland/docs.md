## 855. THE HOMELAND

```txt
1.
The Homeland!  O the Homeland!
The land of the freeborn!
There's no night in the Homeland,
But aye the fadeless morn;
I'm sighing for the Homeland,
My heart is aching here;
There is no pain in the Homeland
To which I'm drawing near;
There is no pain in the Homeland
To which I'm drawing near.

2.
My Lord is in the Homeland,
With angels bright and fair;
There's no sin in the Homeland,
And no temptation there;
The music of the Homeland
Is ringing in my ears;
And when I think of the Homeland
My eyes are filled with tears;
And when I think of the Homeland
My eyes are filled with tears.

3.
The dwellers in the Homeland
Are beck'ning me to come,
Where neither death nor sorrow 
Invades their holy home;
O dear, dear native country!
O rest and peace above!
Christ bring us all to the Homeland
Of Thy redeeming love;
Christ bring us all to the Homeland
Of Thy redeeming love.
