## 881. GOLDEN DAWNING

```txt
1.
I am waiting for the morning
Of the day that brings release,
Waiting for the golden dawning
Of God's everlasting peace.

Chorus:
Hasten on, day eternal!
Bid the night of sorrow cease;
Usher in love supernal,
Bring the golden golden dawn of peace.

2.
O'er the hilltops brightly breaking,
Sun of Righteousness arise,
Ev'ry soul from slumber waking
As God's glory gilds the skies. 

Chorus:
Hasten on, day eternal!
Bid the night of sorrow cease;
Usher in love supernal,
Bring the golden golden dawn of peace.


3.
Endless joy for hours of crying,
Everlasting peace for care;
Immortality for dying,
Hallelujahs glad, for prayer! 

Chorus:
Hasten on, day eternal!
Bid the night of sorrow cease;
Usher in love supernal,
Bring the golden golden dawn of peace.
