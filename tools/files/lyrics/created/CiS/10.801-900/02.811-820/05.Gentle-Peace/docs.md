## 815. GENTLE PEACE

```txt
1.
Gentle Peace, from heav'n descended,
We would live beneath thy law;
Thou hast home and life befriended
Born of nobler deeds than war.

2.
Thou hast thrown a smile of beauty
O'er the meadow, hill, and grove;
Thou hast quickened us to duty,
Thou hast warmed our hearts to love.

3.
Stay thou with us, still replenish
Fields with fruit, ourselves with love;
Discord and dissension banish,
Peaceful spirits from above.
```
