## 812. A THANKFUL HEART

```txt
1.
Father, whate'er of earthly bliss
Thy sov'reign will denies,
Accepted at thy throne of grace,
Let this petition rise:

2.
Give me a calm, a thankful heart,
From ev'ry murmur free;
The blessings of thy grace impart,
And make me live to thee.

3.
Let the sweep hope that thou art mine
My life and death attend;
Thy presence thro' my journey shine,
And crown my journey's end.

```
