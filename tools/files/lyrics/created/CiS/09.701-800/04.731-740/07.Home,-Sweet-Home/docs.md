## 737. HOME, SWEET HOME

```txt
1.
Mid scenes of confusion and creature complaints,
How sweet to my soul is communion of saints;
To find at the banquet of mercy there's room,
And feel in the presence of Jesus at home.
Home, home, sweet, 
Prepare me, dear Saviour, for heaven my home.

2.
Sweet bonds that unite all the children of peace,
And thrice precious Jesus, whose love can not cease!
Tho' oft from thy presence in sadness I roam,
By faith I behold thee in glory at home.
Home, home, sweet,
Prepare me, dear Saviour, for heaven my home.

3.
While where in this valley of conflict I stay,
O give me submission, and strength as my day;
In all my afflictions to thee would I come,
Rejoicing in hope of my glorious home.
Home, home, sweet,
Prepare me, dear Saviour, for heaven my home.
