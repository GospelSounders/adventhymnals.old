## 776. IN THE MORNING

```txt
1.
Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear
My voice ascending high;
To thee will I direct my prayer,
To thee lift up mine eye,

2.
O may thy Spirit guide my feet
In ways of righteousness!
Make ev'ry path of duty straight
And plain before my face.

3.
The men that love and fear thy name
Shall see their hopes fulfilled;
The mighty God will compass them
With favor as a shield.

```
