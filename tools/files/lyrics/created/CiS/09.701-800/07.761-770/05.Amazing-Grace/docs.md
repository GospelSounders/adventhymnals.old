## 765. AMAZING GRACE

```txt
1.
Amazing grace!  how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

2.
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed!

3.
Thro' many dangers, toils, and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.
```
