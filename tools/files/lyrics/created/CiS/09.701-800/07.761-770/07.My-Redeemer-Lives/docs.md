## 767. MY REDEEMER LIVES

```txt
1.
I know that my Redeemer lives,
And ever prays for me;
A token of his love he gives,
A pledge of liberty.

2.
Joyful in hope, my spirit soars
To meet thee from above;
Thy goodness thankfully adores,
And tastes thy precious love.

3.
When God is mine, and I am his,
Of paradise possessed,
I taste unutterable bliss,
And everlasting rest.

```
