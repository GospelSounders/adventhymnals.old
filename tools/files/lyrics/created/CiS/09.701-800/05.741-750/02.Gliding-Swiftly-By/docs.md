## 742. GLIDING SWIFTLY BY

```txt
1.
My days are gliding swiftly by,
And I, a pilgrim stranger,
Would not detain them as they fly
These hours of toil and danger;

Chorus:
For O, we stand on Jordan's strand,
And soon we'll all pass over;
And just before, the shining shore,
We may almost discover.

2.
We'll gird our loins, my brethren dear,
Our distant home discerning;
Our absent Lord has left us word,
Let ev'ry lamp be burning. 

Chorus:
For O, we stand on Jordan's strand,
And soon we'll all pass over;
And just before, the shining shore,
We may almost discover.


3.
Should coming days be cold and dark,
We need not cease our singing;
That perfect rest naught can molest,
Where golden harps are ringing. 

Chorus:
For O, we stand on Jordan's strand,
And soon we'll all pass over;
And just before, the shining shore,
We may almost discover.


4.
Let sorrow's rudest tempests blow,
Each cord on earth to sever,
Our King says, Come, and there's our home, 
Forever, O, forever! 

Chorus:
For O, we stand on Jordan's strand,
And soon we'll all pass over;
And just before, the shining shore,
We may almost discover.
