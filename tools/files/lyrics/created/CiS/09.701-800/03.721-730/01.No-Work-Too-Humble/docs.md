## 721. NO WORK TOO HUMBLE

```txt
1.
There is no work too humble
For Christian hands to do;
There is no path too lowly
For our feet to pursue;
Our blessed Lord and Master
Was servant unto all;
None were to poor and needy
For him to heed their call.

2.
If we are his disciples,
Call'd by his holy name,
A portion of his Spirit
We surely ought to claim.
And tho' the task be menial
Which he for us hath set;
His own divine example
We never should forget.

3.
That he, the High and Holy,
Whose life-work was complete,
Should gird himself for labor,
And washed those humble feet!
And yet we shrink from duties
Which seem so far above
This deed of Christ-like meekness,
This tender proof of love!
