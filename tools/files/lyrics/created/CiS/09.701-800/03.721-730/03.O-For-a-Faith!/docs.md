## 723. O FOR A FAITH!

```txt
1.
O for a faith that will not shrink,
Tho' press'd by many a foe;
That will not tremble on the brink
Of poverty or woe;

2.
That will not murmur or complain
Beneath the chast'ning rod,
But in the hour of grief or pain
Can lean upon its God.

3.
A faith that shines more bright and clear
When tempests rage without;
Then when in danger knows no fear,
In darkness feels no doubt;

4.
That bears unmoved the world's dread frown,
Nor heeds its scornful smile;
That sin's wild ocean cannot drown,
Nor its soft arts beguile.

5.
Lord, give me such a faith as this,
And then, whate'er may come,
I'll taste e'en here the hallowed bliss
Of an eternal home.
