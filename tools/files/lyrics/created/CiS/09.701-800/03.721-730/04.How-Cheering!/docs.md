## 724. HOW CHEERING!

```txt
1.
How cheering is the Christian's hope,
While toiling here below!
It buoys us up while passing thro'
This wilderness of woe,

2.
It points to us a land of rest,
Where saints with Christ will reign,
Where we shall meet the loved of earth,
And never part again,

3.
A land where sin can never come,
Temptations ne'er annoy,
Where happiness will ever dwell,
And that without alloy.

4.
In that bright world no fears will flow,
Death ne'er can enter there;
For all who gain that heavenly land
Will be as angels are.

5.
Fly, ling'ring moments, fly, O fly,
Dear Saviour, quickly come!
We long to see thee as thou art,
And reach that blissful home.
```
