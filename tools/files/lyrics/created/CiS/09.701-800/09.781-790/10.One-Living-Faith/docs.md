## 790. ONE LIVING FAITH

```txt
1.
God's law demands one living faith,
And not a crowd of lifeless creeds;
Its warrant is a firm "God saith;"
Its claim not words, but living deeds.

2.
O Lord, forgive thy holy law
Grows tarnish'd in our earthly clasp;
Pure in itself, without a flaw
It dims in our too worldly grasp.

3.
Forgive the sacrilege, and take
From ev'ry soul th' unholy stain,
And help us for thy Son's dear sake,
To keep thy perfect law again.
```
