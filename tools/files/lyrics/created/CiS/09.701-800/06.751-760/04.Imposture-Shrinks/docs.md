## 754. IMPOSTURE SHRINKS

```txt
1.
Imposture shrinks from light,
And dreads the curious eye;
But sacred truths the test invite,
They bid us search and try.

2.
O may we still maintain
A meek, inquiring mind,
Assured we shall not search in vain,
But hidden treasures find.

3.
With understanding blest,
Created to be free,
Our faith on man we dare not rest,
We trust alone in Thee.
```
