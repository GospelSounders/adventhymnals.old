## 757. LAMP OF OUR FEET

```txt
1.
Lamp of our feet, Whereby we trace
Our path when wont to stray;
Stream from the Fount of heav'nly grace;
Brook by the trav'ler's way;

2.
Bread of our souls, Whereon we feed;
True manna from on high;
Our guide and chart, wherein we read
Of realms beyond the sky;

3.
Pillar of fire thro' watches dark,
And radiant cloud by day;
When waves would whelm our tossing bark,
Our anchor and our stay;

4.
Word of the everlasting God;
Will of his glorious Son,
Without thee how could earth be trod,
Or heav'n itself be won?
