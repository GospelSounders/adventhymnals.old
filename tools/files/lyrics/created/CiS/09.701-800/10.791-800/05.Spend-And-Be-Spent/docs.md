## 795. SPEND AND BE SPENT

```txt
1.
Go, labor on; spend and be spent,
Thy joy to do the Father's will;
It is the way the Master went;
Should not the servant tread it still?

2.
Go, labor on; 'tis not for naught;
Thine earthly loss is heav'nly gain:
Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not:
The Master praises, what are men?

3.
Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice;
For toil comes rest; for exile, home;
Soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom's voice,
The midnight peal:  "Behold, I come!"
```
