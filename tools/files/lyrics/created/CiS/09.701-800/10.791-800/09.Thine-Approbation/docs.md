## 799. THINE APPROBATION

```txt
1.
One precious boon, O Lord, I seek,
While tossed upon life's billowy sea;
To hear a voice within me speak,
"Thy Saviour is well pleased with thee."

2.
Earth's scoffs and scorn well pleased I'll bear,
Nor mourn tho' under foot I'm trod,
If day by day I may but share
Thine approbation, O my God!

3.
Let me but know, where'er I roam,
That I am doing Jesus' will;
And tho' I've neither friends nor home,
My heart shall glow with gladness still.
