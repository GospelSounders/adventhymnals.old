## 798. THOUGH NATURE WEEPS

```txt
1.
Lovely this child, asleep in death;
How beautiful and fair!
Yes, even now, tho' void of breath,
God's impress still is there.

2.
And if thus fair and lovely here,
Beneath death's icy hand,
O will it not be beauteous there,
'Mid the immortal band?

3.
Tho' nature weeps when holy ties
So strongly bound are riv'n,
Yet faith the Saviour's word applies,
"Of such the realms of heav'n."
