## 792. EACH RETURNING MORN

```txt
1.
O Christ, with each returning morn
Thine image to our hearts be borne;
And may we ever clearly see
Our dearest treasure, Lord, in thee!

2.
All hallowed be our walk this day;
May meekness form our morning ray,
And faithful love our noontide light,
And hope our sunset, calm and bright.

3.
May grace each idle thought control,
And sanctify each wayward soul;
May guile depart, and malice cease,
And all within be joy and peace.
```
