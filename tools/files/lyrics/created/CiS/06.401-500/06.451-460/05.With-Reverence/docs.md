## 455. WITH REVERENCE

```txt
1.
With rev'rence let the saints appear,
And bow before the Lord;
His high commands with rev'rence hear,
And tremble at his word,
And tremble at his word.

2.
Sing, all ye ransomed of the Lord,
Your great Deliv'rer sing;
Ye pilgrims now for Zion bound,
Be joyful in your King,
Be joyful in your King.

3.
O Jesus, Lord of earth and heav'n,
Our life and joy, to thee
Be honor, thanks, and blessing giv'n
Thro' all eternity,
Thro' all eternity.
```
