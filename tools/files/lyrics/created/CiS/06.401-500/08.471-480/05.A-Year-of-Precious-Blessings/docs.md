## 475. A YEAR OF PRECIOUS BLESSINGS

```txt
1.
A year of precious blessings,
And glorious vict'ries won,
Of earnest work progressing,
Its onward course has run;
To Thee, O God, our Refuge,
Whose goodness crowns our days,
Within Thy earthly temple
We lift our souls in praise;
Within Thy earthly temple
We lift our souls in praise.

2.
Thou Master of assemblies,
In mighty pow'r descend,
Behold our glad reunion,
Conduct it to the end;
Inspire our hearts with courage,
And deeper love for Thee,
That all Thy Name may honor,
Where'er our field may be;
That all Thy name may honor,
Where'er our field may be.

3.
O Church of God's Anointed,
March on the lost to win,
Lead forth thy ranks victorious
Against the hosts of sin;
Till at His throne in glory,
Where angels prostrate fall,
One Hallelujah chorus
Shall crown Him Lord of all;
One Hallelujah chorus 
Shall crown Him Lord of all.
```
