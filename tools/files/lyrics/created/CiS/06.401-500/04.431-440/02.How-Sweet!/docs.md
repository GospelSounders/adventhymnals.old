## 432. HOW SWEET!

```txt
1.
How sweet upon this sacred day,
The best of all the sev'n,
To cast our earthly thoughts away,
And think of God and heav'n.

2.
How sweet the words of peace to hear
From him to whom 'tis giv'n
To wake the penitential fear,
And lead the way to heav'n.

3.
And if to make our sins depart,
In vain the will has striv'n,
He who regards the inmost heart
Will send his grace from heav'n.
```
