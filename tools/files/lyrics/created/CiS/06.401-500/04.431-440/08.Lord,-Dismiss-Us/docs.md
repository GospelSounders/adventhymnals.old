## 438. LORD, DISMISS US

```txt
1.
Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing,
Fill out hearts with joy and peace;
Let us each Thy love possessing,
Triumph in redeeming grace.
O refresh us, O refresh us,
Traveling thro' this wilderness!

2.
Thanks we give, and adoration,
For Thy gospel's joyful sound;
May the fruits of Thy salvation
In our hearts and lives abound;
Ever faithful, ever faithful,
To Thy truth may we be found.

3.
While our days on earth are strengthened,
May we give them, Lord to Thee;
Cheered by hope, and daily strengthened,
May we run, nor weary be.
Till Thy glory, till Thy glory
Without clouds in heav'n we see.
