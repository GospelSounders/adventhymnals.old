## 483. WE'LL LIVE IN TENTS

```txt
1.
God bids his people on the earth,
Before he comes and calls them hence
To live unknit to home and hearth,
Like far bound travelers in tents.

Chorus:
We'll live in tents until our feet
Shall reach the land by sin untrod,
The gate of pearl, the golden street,
Whose Builder and whose Maker, God.

2.
It is his will that we should pass
Like strangers, sep'rate and aside
From all the vain and worldly mass
That crowd the Babylons of pride. 

Chorus:
We'll live in tents until our feet
Shall reach the land by sin untrod,
The gate of pearl, the golden street,
Whose Builder and whose Maker, God.


3.
He'd have us rear no stately towers,
Sink no foundation walls of stone,
But camp each night a few short hours,
And ere the morrow's dawn move on. 

Chorus:
We'll live in tents until our feet
Shall reach the land by sin untrod,
The gate of pearl, the golden street,
Whose Builder and whose Maker, God.


4.
O brother, whatsoever chain
Binds us to fleshly lust and strife,
Here let us rend it in God's name,
And live, henceforth, the pilgrim life. 

Chorus:
We'll live in tents until our feet
Shall reach the land by sin untrod,
The gate of pearl, the golden street,
Whose Builder and whose Maker, God.
