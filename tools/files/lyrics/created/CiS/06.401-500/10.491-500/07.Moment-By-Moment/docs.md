## 497. MOMENT BY MOMENT

```txt
1.
Moment by moment, hour by hour,
Constantly trusting His keeping pow'r;
Day by day and week by week,
Only His praise my tongue shall speak.

Refrain:
Moment by moment, Helper is He,
Moment by monument dwelling in me;
Gently subduing powers of sin,
Wonderful Saviour is Christ within.

2.
Why for the body anxious thot'? 
Knowing He careth, sweet is my lot;
Mine is the asking, His the store,
Moment by moment, o'er and o'er. 

Refrain:
Moment by moment, Helper is He,
Moment by monument dwelling in me;
Gently subduing powers of sin,
Wonderful Saviour is Christ within.


3.
Why should the spirit doubting weep?
What I've committed, surely He'll keep;
Mine is the trusting, His the pow'r,
Moment by moment, hour by hour. 

Refrain:
Moment by moment, Helper is He,
Moment by monument dwelling in me;
Gently subduing powers of sin,
Wonderful Saviour is Christ within.


4.
Why for the resting sing or sigh,
Selfishly seeking mansions on high?
Earth needeth more of holy love,
Than all the universe above. 

Refrain:
Moment by moment, Helper is He,
Moment by monument dwelling in me;
Gently subduing powers of sin,
Wonderful Saviour is Christ within.
