## 420. ENDLESS LOVE

```txt
1.
My God!  how endless is thy love!
Thy gifts are ev'ry evening new;
And morning mercies from above,
Gently distil, like early dew.

2.
Thou spread'st the curtains of the night,
Great Guardian of my sleeping hours!
Thy sov'reign word restores the light,
And quickens all my drowsy pow'rs.

3.
I yield my pow'rs to thy command;
To thee I consecrate my days;
Perpetual blessings, from thy hand,
Demand perpetual songs of praise.
```
