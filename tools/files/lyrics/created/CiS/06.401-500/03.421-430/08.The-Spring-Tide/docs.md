## 428. THE SPRING-TIDE

```txt
1.
The spring-tide hour brings leaf and flow'r,
With songs of life and love,
And many a lay to cheer the day
In many a leafy grove.

2.
Dews fall apace, the dews of grace,
On souls made sad by sin;
And love divine delights to shine
Upon the waste within.

3.
As year by year the flow'rs appear,
And birds their praises sing,
Why not, my heart, bear well thy part,
In nature's joyous spring?

4.
Lord, let thy love, fresh from above,
Soft as the south wind blow,
Till my heart bloom in sweet perfume,
And fragrant spices flow.
