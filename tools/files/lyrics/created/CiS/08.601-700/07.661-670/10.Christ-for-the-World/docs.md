## 670. CHRIST FOR THE WORLD

```txt
1.
Christ for the world we sing;
The world to Christ we bring,
With loving zeal; 
The poor, and them that mourn,
The faint and overborne,
Sin sick and sorrow worn,
Whom Christ doth heal.

2.
Christ for the world we sing;
The world to Christ we bring,
With fervent pray'r;
The wayward and the lost,
By restless passions toss'd,
Redeemed at countless cost,
From dark despair.

3.
Christ for the world we sing;
The world to Christ we bring,
With joyful song;
The newborn souls, whose days,
Reclaimed from error's ways,
Inspired with hope and praise,
To Christ belong.
