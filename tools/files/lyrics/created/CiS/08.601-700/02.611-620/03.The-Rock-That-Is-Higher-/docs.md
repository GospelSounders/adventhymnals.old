## 613. THE ROCK THAT IS HIGHER 

```txt
1.
O sometimes the shadows are deep,
And rough seems the path to the goal;
And sorrows, how often they sweep
Like tempests down over the soul!

Chorus:
O, then to the Rock let me fly, 
To the Rock that is higher than I;
O, then to the Rock let me fly, 
To the Rock that is higher than I.

2.
O sometimes how long seems the day,
And sometimes how heavy my feet;
But toiling in life's dusty way,
The Rock's blessed shadow, how sweet! 

Chorus:
O, then to the Rock let me fly, 
To the Rock that is higher than I;
O, then to the Rock let me fly, 
To the Rock that is higher than I.


3.
O near to the Rock let me keep,
Or blessings or sorrows prevail;
Or climbing the mountain way steep,
Or walking the shadowy vale. 

Chorus:
O, then to the Rock let me fly, 
To the Rock that is higher than I;
O, then to the Rock let me fly, 
To the Rock that is higher than I.
