## 614. SOMETHING FOR JESUS

```txt
1.
Saviour!  Thy dying love 
Thou gavest me,
Nor should I aught withhold, 
Dear Lord, from Thee;
In love my soul would bow,
My heart fulfill its vow,
Some off'ring bring Thee now,
Something for Thee.

2.
At the blest mercy-seat, 
Pleading for me,
My feeble faith looks up, 
Jesus to Thee;
Help me the cross to bear,
Thy wondrous love declare,
Some song to raise, or pray'r,
Something for Thee.

3.
Give me a faithful heart,
Likeness to Thee,
That each departing day 
henceforth may see;
Some work of love begun,
Some deed of kindness done,
Some wand'rer sought and won,
Something for Thee.

4.
All that I am and have, 
Thy gifts so free,
In joy, in grief, thro' life, 
Dear Lord, for Thee!
And when Thy face I see, 
My ransom'd soul shall be,
Thro' all eternity,
Something for Thee.
