## 696. SILENT MESSENGERS

```txt
1.
Go forth on wings of faith and pray'r,
Ye pages bright with love;
Tho' mute, the joyful tidings bear,
Salvation from above.

Refrain:
Silent messengers, go ye forth,
From ocean to ocean, from South to North;
Seed of the word, it shall not be sown in vain.

2.
Go, tell the sinful, careless soul,
The warning God has giv'n;
Go, make the wounded spirit whole,
With healing balm from heav'n. 

Refrain:
Silent messengers, go ye forth,
From ocean to ocean, from South to North;
Seed of the word, it shall not be sown in vain.


3.
Go to the rude, the dark, the poor,
That live estranged from God;
Bid them the pearl of life secure,
Bo't with a Saviour's blood. 

Refrain:
Silent messengers, go ye forth,
From ocean to ocean, from South to North;
Seed of the word, it shall not be sown in vain.


4.
O Jesus, friend of dying men,
Thy presence we implore;
Without thy blessing all is vain;
Be with us evermore. 

Refrain:
Silent messengers, go ye forth,
From ocean to ocean, from South to North;
Seed of the word, it shall not be sown in vain.
