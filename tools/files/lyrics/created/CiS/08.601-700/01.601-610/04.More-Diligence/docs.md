## 604. MORE DILIGENCE

```txt
1.
More diligence give me;
Swift flieth the day,
Each moment some lost one
Is passing away;
How can I be idle,
Christ knowing so well?
More diligence give me,
Love's story to tell.

2.
More tenderness give me
For wandering sheep,
Like Jesus the Sheperd,
To search and to weep
In byways and hedges,
O'er desert and sea;
More tenderness give me
For sinners like me. 

3.
More gratitude give me,
More love for my Lord,
More gifts for the Giver
Who spreadeth my board;
More mem'ries of mercies,
More praises in pray'r,
More gladness in labor,
More trust with my care.

4.
More purity give me,
More hatred of sin,
More hung'ring and thirsting
For goodness within;
More watching and praying,
From self to be free;
More fruits of the Spirit,
More, Jesus, of thee.
