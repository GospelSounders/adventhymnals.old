## 601. PRECIOUS PROMISE

```txt
1.
Precious promise God hath given
To the weary passer by,
On the way from earth to heaven,
"I will guide thee with mine eye."

Chorus:
I will guide thee,
I will guide thee,
I will guide thee with mine eye;
On the road from earth to heaven,
I will guide thee with mine eye.

2.
When temptations almost win thee,
And thy trusted watchers fly,
Let this promise ring within thee,
"I will guide thee with mine eye." 

Chorus:
I will guide thee,
I will guide thee,
I will guide thee with mine eye;
On the road from earth to heaven,
I will guide thee with mine eye.


3.
When they secret hopes have perished
In the grave of years gone by,
Let this promise still be cherished,
"I will guide thee with mine eye." 

Chorus:
I will guide thee,
I will guide thee,
I will guide thee with mine eye;
On the road from earth to heaven,
I will guide thee with mine eye.


4.
When the shades of life are falling,
And the hour has come to die,
Hear the trusty Pilot calling,
"I will guide thee with mine eye." 

Chorus:
I will guide thee,
I will guide thee,
I will guide thee with mine eye;
On the road from earth to heaven,
I will guide thee with mine eye.
