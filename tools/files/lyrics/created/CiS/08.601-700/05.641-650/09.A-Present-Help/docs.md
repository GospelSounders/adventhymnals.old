## 649. A PRESENT HELP

```txt
1.
There is never a day so dreary,
But God can make it bright;
And to the soul that trusts him,
He giveth pure delight;
There is never a path so hidden,
But God will show the way,
If we will seek his guidance,
And patiently will pray.

2.
There is never a cross so heavy,
But Jesus' hands are there,
Outstretched in sweet compassion,
Our burden still to bear;
There is never a life so darkened,
So hopeless, so unblest,
But may be fill'd with gladness,
In Jesus' peace may rest.

3.
There is never a heart so broken,
But Jesus Christ can heal;
The heart once pierced on Calv'ry
Doth for his people feel;
He will never fulfill his promise,
His word can never fail;
God is our help in trouble,
Our strength when foes assail.
