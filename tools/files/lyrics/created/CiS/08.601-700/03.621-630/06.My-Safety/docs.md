## 626. MY SAFETY

```txt
1.
O Lamb of God!  still keep me
Near to Thy wounded side;
'Tis only there in safety
And peace I can abide!
What foes and snares surround me,
What doubts and fears within!
The grace that sought and found me,
Alone can keep me clean.

2.
'Tis only in Thee hiding
I know my life secure
Only in Thee abiding,
The conflict can endure:
Thine arm the victory gaineth
O'er ev'ry hateful foe;
Thy love my heart sustaineth
In all its care and woe.

3.
Soon shall my eyes behold Thee,
With rapture, face to face;
One half hath not been told me
Of all Thy pow'r and grace.
Thy beauty, Lord, and glory,
The wonders of Thy love,
Shall be the endless story
Of all the saints above.
```
