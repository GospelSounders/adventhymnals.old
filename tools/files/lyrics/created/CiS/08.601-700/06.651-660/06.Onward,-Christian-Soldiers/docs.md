## 656. ONWARD, CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS

```txt
1.
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.
Christ the royal Master,
Leads against the foe,
Forward into battle, 
See his banners go!

Chorus:
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before.

2.
At the sign of triumph
Satan's host doth feel,
On then Christian soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell's foundations quiver
At the shout of praise,
Brothers, lift your voices, 
Loud your anthems raise. 

Chorus:
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before.


3.
Like a mighty army
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers we are treading
Where the saints have trod;
We are not divided,
All one body we,
One in hope and doctrine,
One in charity. 

Chorus:
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before.


4.
Crowns and thrones have perished,
Kingdoms ruled and waned,
But the Church of Jesus
Constant has remained.
Gates of hell can never
'Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise,
That can never fail. 

Chorus:
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before.


5.
Onward, then, ye people!
Join our happy throng,
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph song;
Glory, praise, and honor
Unto Christ the King;
This thro' countless ages 
Men and angels sing. 

Chorus:
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus 
Going on before.
