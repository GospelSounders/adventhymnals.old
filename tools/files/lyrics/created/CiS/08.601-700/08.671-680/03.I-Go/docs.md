## 673. I GO

```txt
1.
Answer the call, ye brave men,
The Master's call to save men;
Each moment death is gaining,
Their blood our garments staining:

Chorus:
Who'll go?  who'll go, whate'er the cost?
Who'll go?  who'll go to save the lost?

2.
Lighting the world with glory,
Once more the gospel story
In purity and pow'r
Proclaims the judgment hour: 

Chorus:
Who'll go?  who'll go, whate'er the cost?
Who'll go?  who'll go to save the lost?


3.
Nations afar are waking,
Their idol shrines forsaking;
God's truth puts on its splendor,
Immanuel its defender: 

Chorus:
Who'll go?  who'll go, whate'er the cost?
Who'll go?  who'll go to save the lost?


4.
Bearing the name of Jesus,
Whose great salvation frees us,
With joy the good news carry, 
Nor dare to longer tarry: 

Chorus:
Who'll go?  who'll go, whate'er the cost?
Who'll go?  who'll go to save the lost?


5.
Where icy winds are crying,
Where India's poor are dying,
Where Southern seas are sleeping,
Where Western isles are weeping.  

Chorus:  I go, I go, whate'er the cost;
I go, I go to save the lost.
