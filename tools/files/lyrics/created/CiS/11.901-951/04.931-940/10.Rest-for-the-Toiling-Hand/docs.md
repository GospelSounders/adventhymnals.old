## 940. REST FOR THE TOILING HAND

```txt
1.
Rest for the toiling hand,
Rest for the anxious brow,
Rest for the weary, way-worn feet,
Rest from all labor now.

2.
Soon shall the trump of God
Give out the welcome sound
That shakes thy silent chamber walls,
And breaks the turf-sealed ground.

3.
'Twas sown in weakness here,
'Twill then be raised in pow'r;
That which was sown as earthly seed,
Shall rise a heav'nly flow'r!
