## 932. SOON SHALL WE MEET

```txt
1.
Soon shall we meet again,
Meet ne'er to sever,
Soon shall peace wreathe her chain
Round us forever;
Our hearts can ne'er repose,
Safe from each blast that blows.
In this dark vale of woes;
Never, no, never!

2.
Soon shall love freely flow
Pure as life's river;
Soon shall sweet friendship glow,
Changeless forever.
Where joys celestial thrill,
There bliss each heart shall fill.
And fears of parting chill
Never, no, never!

3.
Then to that world of light
Take us, dear Saviour;
May we all there unite,
Blessed forever;
Where kindred spirits dwell,
There may our music swell,
And time our joys dispell
Never, no, never!
