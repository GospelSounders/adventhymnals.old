## 933. BREAK, ETERNAL DAY

```txt
1.
Break, break, eternal day,
Bid darkness flee away;
Pour on our sight
Light from the world of joy,
Bliss pure without alloy;
Then ne'er shall gloom annoy;
All shall be bright.

2.
Rise, rise, thou glorious Sun,
Hasten thy race to run;
At God's command 
Extend thy healing wings;
Open joy's long-sealed springs;
Reign, O thou King of kings,
In this dark land.

3.
Come, come, thou conqu'ring One,
Reign upon thy throne,
In glory bright;
Then shall the ransomed raise,
Unceasing songs of praise,
Thro'out eternal days,
In realms of light.
