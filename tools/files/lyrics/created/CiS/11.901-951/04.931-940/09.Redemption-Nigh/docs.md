## 939. REDEMPTION NIGH

```txt
1.
In the sun, and moon, and stars,
Signs and wonders have appeared;
Earth has groan'd with bloody wars,
And the hearts of men have fear'd.

2.
Soon shall ocean's hoary deep,
Tossed with stronger tempests, rise;
Darker storms the mountains sweep,
Fiercer lightnings rend the skies.

3.
Dread alarms shall shake the proud,
Pale amazement, restless fear;
And amid the thunder cloud
Shall the Judge of men appear.

4.
But, tho' from his awful face,
Heav'n shall fade, and earth shall fly,
Fear not ye, his chosen race,
Your redemption draweth nigh.
