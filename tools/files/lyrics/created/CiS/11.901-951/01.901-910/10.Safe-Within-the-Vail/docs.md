## 910. SAFE WITHIN THE VAIL

```txt
1.
"Land ahead!"  its fruits are waving
O'er the hills of fadeless green,
And the living waters laving
Shores where heav'nly forms are seen.

Chorus:
Rock and storms I'll fear no more,
When on that eternal shore;
I am safe within the vail!

2.
Onward bark!  the cape I'm rounding;
See the blessed wave their hands!
Hear the harps of God resounding
From the bright immortal band! 

Chorus:
Rock and storms I'll fear no more,
When on that eternal shore;
I am safe within the vail!


3.
Now we're safe from all temptation,
All the storms of life are past
Praise the Rock of our salvation,
We are safe at home at last! 

Chorus:
Rock and storms I'll fear no more,
When on that eternal shore;
I am safe within the vail!
