## 946. BEAR ME ON

```txt
1.
O how I long to see that day
When the redeemed shall come
To Zion, clad in white array
Their blissful, happy home.

Chorus:
O bear me on, bear me on
To Mount Zion;
O bear me on to that city of love
Where saints shall ever dwell.

2.
I'll hear the alleluias roll
From the unnumbered throng,
And with a heaven-enraptured soul
I'll join redemption's song. 

Chorus:
O bear me on, bear me on
To Mount Zion;
O bear me on to that city of love
Where saints shall ever dwell.


3.
All hail!  the morn of glory's nigh
The pilgrim longs to see
That dries the tear from every eye
Creation's jubilee. 

Chorus:
O bear me on, bear me on
To Mount Zion;
O bear me on to that city of love
Where saints shall ever dwell.
