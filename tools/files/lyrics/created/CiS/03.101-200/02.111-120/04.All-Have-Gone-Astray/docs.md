## 114. ALL HAVE GONE ASTRAY

```txt
1.
We all, O Lord, have gone astray,
And wandered from Thy heav'nly way.
The wilds of sin our feet have trod,
Far from the paths of Thee, our God,
Far from the paths of Thee, our God.

2.
In penitential grief we sigh,
And lift to Thee our humble cry,
Won by Thy love, we turn to Him
Who died to save us from our sin,
Who died to save us from our sin.

3.
Hear us, great Shepherd of Thy sheep!
Our wand'rings heal, our footsteps keep.
We seek Thy shelt'ring fold again,  
Nor shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain,
Nor shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain.

4.
O God!  we praise Thee for Thy grace.
How sweet the smiling of Thy face!
O let Thy grace our hearts control,
And fill with love each longing soul,
And fill with love each longing soul.

5.
Teach us to know and love Thy way;
And grant to life s remotest day,
By Thine unerring guidance led,
Our willing feet Thy paths may tread,
Our willing feet Thy paths may tread.
