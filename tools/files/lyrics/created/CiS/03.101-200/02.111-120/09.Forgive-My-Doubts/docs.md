## 119. FORGIVE MY DOUBTS

```txt
1.
Forgive, O Lord, the doubts that break
Thy promises to me;
Forgive me that I fail to take 
My pardon, full and free.
I sought to put my sins away,
I strove to do Thy will,
And yet, whene'er I tried to pray,
My heart was doubting still.

2.
I tho't that Thou with jealous eyes
Wast watching me alway,
My deeds to mark, my steps to spy,
Whene'er I went astray;
I hoped that when, by days and years
Of service and of prayer,
I had besought Thy grace with tears,
Thy mercy I might share.

3.
Forgive, O Father, this my sin,
This jealous, doubting heart;
For when men seek Thy love to win,
And choose the better part,
I know that, swifter than the light
Leaps earthward from the sun,
Thy pard'ning love,
Thy rescuing might,
Speed down to ev'ry one.
