## 176. I WILL NOT LET THEE GO

```txt
1.
Come, O thou Traveler unknown,
Whom still I bold, but can not see;
My company before is gone,
And I am left alone with thee;
With thee all night I mean to stay,
And wrestle till the break of day.

2.
I need not tell thee who I am;
My sin and misery declare;
Thyself hast called me by my name,
Look on thy hands, and read it there;
But who, I ask thee, who art thou?
Tell me thy name, and tell me now.

3.
In vain thou strugglest to get free;
I never will unloose my hold;
Art thou the Man that died for me?
The secret of thy love unfold;
Wrestling, I will not let thee go,
Till I thy name, thy nature know.
```
