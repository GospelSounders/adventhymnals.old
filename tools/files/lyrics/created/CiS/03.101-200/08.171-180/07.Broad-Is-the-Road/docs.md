## 177. BROAD IS THE ROAD

```txt
1.
Broad is the road that leads to death,
And thousands walk together there;
But wisdom shows a narrow path,
With here and there a traveler.

2.
Deny thyself, and take thy cross,
Is thy Redeemer's great command;
Nature must count her gold but dross,
If she would gain that heav'nly land.

3.
The fearful soul that tires and faints,
And walks the ways of God no more;
Is but esteem'd almost a saint,
And makes his own destruction sure.

```
