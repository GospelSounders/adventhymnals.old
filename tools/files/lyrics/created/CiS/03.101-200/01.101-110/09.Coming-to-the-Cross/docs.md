## 109. COMING TO THE CROSS

```txt
1.
I am coming to the cross,
I am poor, and weak, and blind;
I am counting all but dross,
I shall full salvation find.

Refrain:
I am trusting, Lord, in thee,
Blessed Lamb of Calvary!
Humbly at thy cross I bow,
Save me, Jesus, save me now.

2.
Long my heart has sigh'd for thee,
Long has evil reigned within;
Jesus sweetly speaks to me,
"I will cleanse you from all sin." 

Refrain:
I am trusting, Lord, in thee,
Blessed Lamb of Calvary!
Humbly at thy cross I bow,
Save me, Jesus, save me now.


3.
Here I give my all to thee,
Friends and time and earthly store;
Soul and body thine to be,
Wholly thine forevermore. 

Refrain:
I am trusting, Lord, in thee,
Blessed Lamb of Calvary!
Humbly at thy cross I bow,
Save me, Jesus, save me now.


4.
In thy promises I trust,
Now I feel the blood applied;
I am prostrate in the dust,
I with Christ am crucified. 

Refrain:
I am trusting, Lord, in thee,
Blessed Lamb of Calvary!
Humbly at thy cross I bow,
Save me, Jesus, save me now.


5.
Jesus comes!  he fills my soul;
Perfected in him I am;
I am ev'ry whit made whole;
Glory, glory to the Lamb!  

Refrain:
I am trusting, Lord, in thee,
Blessed Lamb of Calvary!
Humbly at thy cross I bow,
Jesus saves me, saves me now.
