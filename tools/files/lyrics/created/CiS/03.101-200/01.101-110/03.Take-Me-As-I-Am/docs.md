## 103. TAKE ME AS I AM

```txt
1.
Jesus, my Lord, to thee I cry;
Unless thou help me I must die;
Oh, bring thy free salvation nigh,
And take me as I am.

Refrain:
Take me as I am,
Take me as I am,
Oh, bring thy free salvation nigh,
And take me as I am.

2.
Helpless I am, and full of guilt,
But yet thy blood for me was spilt;
And thou canst make me what thou wilt,
But take me as I am. 

Refrain:
Take me as I am,
Take me as I am,
Oh, bring thy free salvation nigh,
And take me as I am.


3.
No preparation can I make,
My best resolves I only break;
Yet save me for thine own name's sake,
And take me as I am. 

Refrain:
Take me as I am,
Take me as I am,
Oh, bring thy free salvation nigh,
And take me as I am.


4.
I bow before thy mercy seat,
Behold me, Savior, at thy feet;
Thy work begin, thy work complete, 
And take me as I am. 

Refrain:
Take me as I am,
Take me as I am,
Oh, bring thy free salvation nigh,
And take me as I am.


5.
If thou hast work for me to do,
Inspire my will, my heart renew;
And work both in, and by me, too,
And take me as I am. 

Refrain:
Take me as I am,
Take me as I am,
Oh, bring thy free salvation nigh,
And take me as I am.


6.
And when at last the work is done,
The battle fought, the vict'ry won,
Still, still my cry shall be alone,
Lord, take me as I am. 

Refrain:
Take me as I am,
Take me as I am,
Oh, bring thy free salvation nigh,
And take me as I am.
