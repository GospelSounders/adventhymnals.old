## 199. REDEEMED

```txt
1.
Redeemed!  how I love to proclaim it!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed thro' his infinite mercy,
His child, and forever, I am.  

Refrain:
Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child, and forever, I am.

2.
Redeemed!  and so happy in Jesus!
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of his presence
With me doth continually dwell. 

Refrain:
Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child, and forever, I am.


3.
I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of him all the day long;
I sing; for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song. 

Refrain:
Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child, and forever, I am.


4.
I know I shall see in his beauty
The King in whose law I delight,
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night. 

Refrain:
Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child, and forever, I am.


5.
I know there's a crown that is waiting
In yonder bright mansion for me;
And soon, with the spirits made perfect,
At home with the Lord I shall be. 

Refrain:
Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child, and forever, I am.
