## 152. NOT BLOOD OF BEASTS

```txt
1.
Not all the blood of beasts
On Jewish altars slain,
Could give the guilty conscience peace,
Or wash away the stain.

2.
But Christ, the heav'nly Lamb,
Takes all our sins away;
A sacrifice of nobler name
And rich blood than they.

3.
My faith would lay her hand
On that dear head of thine,
While like a penitent I stand,
And there confess my sin.
```
