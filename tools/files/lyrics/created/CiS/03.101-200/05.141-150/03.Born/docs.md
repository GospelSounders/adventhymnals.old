## 143. BORN

```txt
1.
How solemn are the words,
And yet to faith how plain,
Which Jesus uttered while on earth
"Ye must be born again!"
"Ye must be born again!"
For so hath God decreed;
No reformation will suffice
'Tis life poor sinners need.

2.
"Ye must be born again!
And life in Christ must have;
In vain the soul may elsewhere go
'Tis He alone can save.
"Ye must be born again!"
Or never enter heav'n;
'Tis only blood-washed ones are there
The ransomed and forgiv'n. 

```
