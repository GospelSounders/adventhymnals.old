## 144. COMING

```txt
1.
He's coming once again,
To set his people free;
That where he is, in glory bright,
His saints may also be.
Then lift the drooping head.
Look up, rejoice and sing;
He comes in majesty sublime,
Salvation's glorious King!

2.
The earth shall quake with fear,
The heav'ns shall flee away;
And where shall guilty man appear
In that tremendous day?
No refuge then is night,
No shelter from the blast;
The night of vengeance vails the sky
When mercy's day is past.

3.
His eyes of living flame,
The wicked shall devour;
No tongue will lightly speak the name
Of Jesus in that hour.
No scorn, no words of hate,
For his meek foll'wers then;
But prayers and tears that come too late,
Will mark earth's mighty men.
