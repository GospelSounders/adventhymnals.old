## 142. CLEANSED

```txt
1.
Cast out the buyers, Lord,
The sellers bid depart;
Cleanse me from carnal thought and word,
And purify my heart.
A temple would I be,
Meet for the royal Son:
Ye money-changers, fear and flee
Before the Sinless One.

2.
The love of self o'erthrow;
The love of God bring in,
That ministers to all below,
God's remedy for sin.
Rise up!  thou Living Word,
Thine arm of strength lay bare,
That naught in me henceforth be heard
But voice of praise and pray'r.

3.
When thus this robber's home
Becomes a house of pray'r,
Do Thou with all thy power come,
And dwell forever there,
The hopeless ones to cheer,
And broken hearts make whole;
In me do thou alone appear
To ev'ry sin-sick soul.
