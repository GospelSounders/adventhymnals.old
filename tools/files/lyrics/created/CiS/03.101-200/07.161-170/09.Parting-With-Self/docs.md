## 169. PARTING WITH SELF

```txt
1.
And must I part with all of self,
My dearest Lord, for thee?
It is but right since thou hast done
Much more than this for me.

2.
Yes, let it go; one look from thee
Will more than make amends
For all the losses I sustain
Of honor, riches, friends.

3.
Ten thousand worlds, ten thousand lives,
How worthless they appear
Compared with thee, supremely good,
Divinely bright and fair!
```
