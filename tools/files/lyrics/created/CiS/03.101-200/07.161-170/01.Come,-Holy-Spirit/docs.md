## 161. COME, HOLY SPIRIT

```txt
1.
Come, Holy Spirit, come,
Let thy bright beams arise,
Dispel the sorrow from our minds,
The darkness from our eyes.

2.
Convince us all of sin,
Then lead to Jesus' blood,
And to our wond'ring view reveal
The mercies of our God.

3.
'Tis thine to cleanse the heart,
To sanctify the soul,
To pour fresh life in ev'ry part,
And new create the whole.
```
