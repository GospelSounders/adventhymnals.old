## 121. WEARY OF EARTH

```txt
1.
Weary of earth and laden with my sin,
I look to heav'n and long to enter in;
But there no evil thing may find a home:
And yet I hear a voice that bids me "Come."

2.
The while I fain would tread the heav'nly way,
Evil is ever with me day by day;
Yet on mine ears the gracious tidings fall,
"Repent, return, thou shalt be loos'd from all."

3.
Cease, restless will!  thy lonely strife resign!
I know too well how little strength is mine;
Grant me, dear Lord, thy saving love to see:
I strive no more, I give myself to thee.
