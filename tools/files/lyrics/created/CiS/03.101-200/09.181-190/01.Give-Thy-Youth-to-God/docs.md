## 181. GIVE THY YOUTH TO GOD

```txt
1.
Give, thou, thy youth to God,
With all its budding love;
Send up thy op'ning heart to him,
Fix it on things above.

2.
He seeks thy heart, my child;
He wants to make thee blest;
Thy soul with his own joy to fill,
To give thee peace and rest.

3.
Take, thou, the side of God,
In all things great or small,
So shall he ever take thy side,
And bear thee safe thro' all.
