## 393. THY MERCIES

```txt
1.
When all thy mercies, O my God!
My rising soul surveys,
Transported with the view, 
I'm lost in wonder, love, and praise.

2.
Unnumbered comforts to my soul
Thy tender care bestowed,
Before my infant heart discerned
From whom those blessings flowed.

3.
Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
My daily thanks employ;
Nor is the least a cheerful heart,
That tastes these gifts with joy.

4.
O, how can words with equal warmth
The gratitude declare
That glows within my raptured heart?
But thou canst read it there.

5.
Through all eternity, to thee
A joyful song I'll raise:
But O, eternity's too short
To utter all thy praise!
