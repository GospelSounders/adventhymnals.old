## 397. REJOICE AND BE GLAD

```txt
1.
Rejoice and be glad, the Redeemer has come;
Go look on his cradle, his cross, and his tomb.

Chorus:
Sound His praises, tell the story
Of Him who was slain;
Sound his praises, tell with gladness,
He liveth again.
Final:  He cometh again.

2.
Rejoice and be glad, for the Lamb that was slain,
O'er death is triumphant, and liveth again. 

Chorus:
Sound His praises, tell the story
Of Him who was slain;
Sound his praises, tell with gladness,
He liveth again.
Final:  He cometh again.


3.
Rejoice and be glad, for our King is on high,
He pleadeth for us on his throne in the sky. 

Chorus:
Sound His praises, tell the story
Of Him who was slain;
Sound his praises, tell with gladness,
He liveth again.
Final:  He cometh again.


4.
Rejoice and be glad, for he cometh again,
He cometh in glory, the Lamb that was slain. 

Chorus:
Sound His praises, tell the story
Of Him who was slain;
Sound his praises, tell with gladness,
He liveth again.
Final:  He cometh again.
