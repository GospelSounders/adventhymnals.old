## 366. BLESSED QUIETNESS

```txt
1.
Joys are flowing like a river,
Since the Comforter has come;
He abides with us forever,
Makes the trusting heart his home.

Chorus:
Blessed quietness, holy quietness, 
Sweet assurance in my soul;
On the stormy sea,
Jesus speaks to me,
And the billows cease to roll.

2.
O what holy peace and gladness!
What a comfort is our Guest,
No more unbelief and sadness,
As obeying now we rest. 

Chorus:
Blessed quietness, holy quietness, 
Sweet assurance in my soul;
On the stormy sea,
Jesus speaks to me,
And the billows cease to roll.


3.
Like the rain that falls from heaven,
Like the sunlight from the sky,
So the Holy Ghost is given,
Coming gently from on high. 

Chorus:
Blessed quietness, holy quietness, 
Sweet assurance in my soul;
On the stormy sea,
Jesus speaks to me,
And the billows cease to roll.


4.
Lo!  a fruitful field is growing,
Blessed fruits of righteousness;
And the streams of life are flowing
In the lonely wilderness. 

Chorus:
Blessed quietness, holy quietness, 
Sweet assurance in my soul;
On the stormy sea,
Jesus speaks to me,
And the billows cease to roll.


5.
What a wonderful salvation,
Where we always see his face!
What a peaceful habitation!
What a quiet resting place! 

Chorus:
Blessed quietness, holy quietness, 
Sweet assurance in my soul;
On the stormy sea,
Jesus speaks to me,
And the billows cease to roll.
