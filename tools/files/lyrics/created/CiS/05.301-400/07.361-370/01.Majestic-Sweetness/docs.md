## 361. MAJESTIC SWEETNESS

```txt
1.
Majestic sweetness sits enthron'd
Upon the Saviour's brow;
His head with radiant light is crown'd,
His lips with grace o'erflow,
His lips with grace o'erflow.

2.
No mortal can with him compare,
Among the sons of men;
Fairer is he than all the fair
That fill the heav'nly train,
That fill the heav'nly train.

3.
He saw me plung'd in deep distress,
He flew to my relief;
For me he bore the shameful cross,
And carried all my grief,
And carried all my grief.

4.
To him I owe my life and breath,
And all the joys I have;
He makes me triumph over death,
He saves me from the grave,
He saves me from the grave.

5.
To heaven, the place of his abode,
He brings my weary feet;
Shows me the glories of my God,
And makes my joy complete.

6.
Since from his bounty I receive
Such proofs of love divine,
Had I a thousand hearts to give,
Lord, they should all be thine.
