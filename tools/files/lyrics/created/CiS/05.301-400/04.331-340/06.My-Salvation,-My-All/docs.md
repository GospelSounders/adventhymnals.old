## 336. MY SALVATION, MY ALL

```txt
1.
O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,
On whom in affliction I call,
My comfort by day and my song in the night,
My hope, my salvation, my all!

2.
His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,
Is heard thro' the shadows of death;
The cedars of Lebanon bow at his feet,
The air is perfum'd with his breath.

3.
His lips, as a fountain of righteousness flow,
To water the gardens of grace;
From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,
And bask in the smiles of his face.

4.
He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,
And myriads wait for his word;
He speaks, and eternity, fill'd with his voice,
Reechoes the praise of the Lord.
