## 338. PURER YET AND PURER

```txt
1.
Purer yet and purer
I would be in mind,
Dearer yet and dearer
Ev'ry duty find;
Hoping still and trusting
God without a fear,
Patiently believing
He will make all clear.

2.
Calmer yet and calmer
In the hours of pain,
Surer yet and surer
Peace at last to gain;
Suff'ring still and doing,
To His will resigned,
And to God subduing
Heart and will and mind.

3.
Higher yet and higher
Out of clouds and night,
Nearer yet and nearer
Rising to the light
Light serene and holy,
Where my soul may rest,
Purified and lowly,
Sanctified and blest.

4.
Swifter yet and swifter
Ever onward run,
Firmer yet and firmer
Step as I go on;
Oft these earnest longings
Swell within my breast,
Yet their inner meaning
Ne'er can be express'd.  Amen.
