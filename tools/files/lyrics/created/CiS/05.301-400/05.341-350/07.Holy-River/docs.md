## 347. HOLY RIVER

```txt
1.
Fresh from the throne of glory,
Bright in its crystal gleam,
Bursts out the living Fountain,
Swells on the living Stream.

Refrain:
Holy River, I would ever
Draw my life from thee;
Mighty River, I will never
Cease to sing of thee.

2.
Stream full of life and gladness,
Spring of all health and peace,
No harps by thee hang silent,
Nor happy voices cease. 

Refrain:
Holy River, I would ever
Draw my life from thee;
Mighty River, I will never
Cease to sing of thee.


3.
River of God, I greet thee,
Now not afar, but near;
My soul to thy still waters
Hastes in its thirstings here. 

Refrain:
Holy River, I would ever
Draw my life from thee;
Mighty River, I will never
Cease to sing of thee.


4.
Jesus, the healing Fountain,
Fresh from the throne above,
Thou art the living water,
Thou art the stream of love. 

Refrain:
Holy River, I would ever
Draw my life from thee;
Mighty River, I will never
Cease to sing of thee.
