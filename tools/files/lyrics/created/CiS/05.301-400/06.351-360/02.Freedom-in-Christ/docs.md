## 352. FREEDOM IN CHRIST

```txt
1.
Conq'ring kings their titles take
From the foes they captive make;
Jesus, by a nobler deed,
From the thousands He hath freed.
Yes; none other Name is giv'n
Unto mortals under heav'n,
Which can make the dead arise,
And exalt them to the skies.

2.
That which Christ so hardly wrought,
That which He so dearly bought,
That salvation, mortals may
Spurn and madly cast away;
Rather gladly for that Name
Bear the cross, endure the shame;
Joyfully for Him to die
Is not death, but victory.

3.
Jesus, Who dost condescend
To be called the sinner's Friend,
Hear us as to Thee, we pray,
Glorifying in Thy Name today.
Glory to the Father be,
Glory, holy Son, to Thee,
Glory to the Holy Ghost,
From the saints and angel host.  Amen.
