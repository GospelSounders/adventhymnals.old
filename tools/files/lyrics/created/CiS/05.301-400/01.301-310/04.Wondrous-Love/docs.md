## 304. WONDROUS LOVE

```txt
1.
God loved the world of sinners lost
And ruined by the fall;
Salvation full, at highest cost,
He offers free to all.

Chorus:
Oh, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love!
The love of God to me;
It bro't my Saviour from above,
To die on Calvary.

2.
E'en now by faith I claim Him mine,
The risen Son of God;
Redemption by His death I find,
And cleansing thro' the blood. 

Chorus:
Oh, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love!
The love of God to me;
It bro't my Saviour from above,
To die on Calvary.


3.
Love brings the glorious fullness in,
And to His saints makes known,
The blessed rest from inbred sin,
Thro' faith in Christ alone. 

Chorus:
Oh, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love!
The love of God to me;
It bro't my Saviour from above,
To die on Calvary.


4.
Believing souls, rejoicing go;
There shall to you be giv'n
A glorious foretaste, here below,
Of endless life in heav'n. 

Chorus:
Oh, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love!
The love of God to me;
It bro't my Saviour from above,
To die on Calvary.


5.
Of vict'ry now o'er Satan's pow'r
Let all the ransom'd sing,
And triumph in the dying hour
Thro' Christ the Lord, our King. 

Chorus:
Oh, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love!
The love of God to me;
It bro't my Saviour from above,
To die on Calvary.
