## 303. ONLY THEE

```txt
1.
Have I need of aught, O Saviour!
Aught on earth but thee?
Have I any in the heavens,
Any one but thee?

Chorus:
Only thee, only thee,
O the wondrous love shown me!
Only thee, only thee,
None on earth but thee.

2.
Tho' I have of friends so many,
Love, and gold, and health;
If I have not thee, my Saviour,
Hold I any wealth? 

Chorus:
Only thee, only thee,
O the wondrous love shown me!
Only thee, only thee,
None on earth but thee.


3.
Is there heart so kind and patient
With my failings all?
Or a voice so true and ready,
Answering my call? 

Chorus:
Only thee, only thee,
O the wondrous love shown me!
Only thee, only thee,
None on earth but thee.


4.
Not for worlds would I exchange it,
This sweet faith in thee!
Earthly treasures cannot equal
All thou art to me. 

Chorus:
Only thee, only thee,
O the wondrous love shown me!
Only thee, only thee,
None on earth but thee.
