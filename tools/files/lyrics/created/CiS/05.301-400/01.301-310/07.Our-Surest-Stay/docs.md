## 307. OUR SUREST STAY

```txt
1.
When softly falls the twilight hour,
O'er moor and mountain, field and flow'r,
How sweet to leave a world of care,
And lift to heav'n the voice of pray'r!

2.
In solemn midnight's silence deep,
When Nature's voice is hush'd in sleep,
Then heavy hearts with grief oppress'd
May find in pray'r the sweetest rest.

3.
And when with red'ning blush of morn
The newborn day begins to dawn,
Then upward to the mercy-seat
Let pray'r ascend like incense sweet.

4.
When midday's burning heat we feel,
When daily cares our hearts would steal,
O, then to heav'n we look away,
And find in pray'r our surest stay.
