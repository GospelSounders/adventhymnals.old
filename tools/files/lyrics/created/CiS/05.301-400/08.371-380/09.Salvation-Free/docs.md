## 379. SALVATION FREE

```txt
1.
Come, ye that love the Lord,
And let your joy be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne.

Chorur:
I'm glad salvation's free,
I'm glad salvation's free;
Salvation's free for you and me;
I'm glad salvation's free.

2.
Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God;
But servants of the heav'nly King
May speak their joys abroad. 

null


3.
Then let our songs a bound,
And ev'ry tear be dry;
We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground
To fairer worlds on high.
