## 330. I SING THE POWER OF GOD

```txt
1.
I sing the mighty pow'r of God,
That made the mountains rise,
That spread the flowing seas abroad,
And built the lofty skies;
I sing the wisdom that ordained
The sun to rule the day;
The moon shines full at his command,
And all the stars obey.

2.
I sing the goodness of the Lord,
That filled the earth with food;
He formed the creatures with his word,
And then pronounced them good.
Lord, how thy wonders are displayed
Where'er I turn my eye!
If I survey the ground I tread,
Or gaze upon the sky!

3.
There's not a plant or flow'r below
But makes thy glories known;
And clouds arise, and tempests blow,
By order from thy throne.
Creatures that borrow life from thee
Are subject to thy care;
There's not a place where we can flee
But God is present there.
