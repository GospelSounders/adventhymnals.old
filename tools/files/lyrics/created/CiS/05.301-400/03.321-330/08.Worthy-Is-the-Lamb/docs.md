## 328. WORTHY IS THE LAMB

```txt
1.
Worthy, worthy, is the Lamb,
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb;
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb
That was slain.

Chorus:
Glory, hallelujah!  
Praise him, hallelujah!
Glory, hallelujah
To the Lamb!

2.
Saviour, let thy kingdom come!
Now the pow'r of sin consume;
Bring thy blest millennium,
Holy Lamb. 

Chorus:
Glory, hallelujah!  
Praise him, hallelujah!
Glory, hallelujah
To the Lamb!


3.
Thus may we each moment feel,
Love him, serve him, praise him still,
Till we all on Zion's hill
See the Lamb. 

Chorus:
Glory, hallelujah!  
Praise him, hallelujah!
Glory, hallelujah
To the Lamb!
