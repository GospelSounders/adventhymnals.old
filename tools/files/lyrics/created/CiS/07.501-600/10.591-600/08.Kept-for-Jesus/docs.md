## 598. KEPT FOR JESUS

```txt
1.
Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"
Kept, by the pow'r of God;
Kept, from the world unspotted,
Treading where Jesus trod.

Refrain:
Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"
Lord at Thy feet I fall;
I would be "nothing, nothing, nothing;"
Thou shalt be "all in all."

2.
Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"
Serving as He shall choose;
"Kept" for the Master's pleasure;
"Kept" for the Master's use. 

Refrain:
Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"
Lord at Thy feet I fall;
I would be "nothing, nothing, nothing;"
Thou shalt be "all in all."


3.
Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"
Kept from the world apart;
Lowly in mind and spirit,
Gentle and pure in heart. 

Refrain:
Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"
Lord at Thy feet I fall;
I would be "nothing, nothing, nothing;"
Thou shalt be "all in all."


4.
Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"
Oh, to be all His own!
Kept, to be His forever,
Kept to be His alone! 

Refrain:
Oh, to be "Kept for Jesus!"
Lord at Thy feet I fall;
I would be "nothing, nothing, nothing;"
Thou shalt be "all in all."
