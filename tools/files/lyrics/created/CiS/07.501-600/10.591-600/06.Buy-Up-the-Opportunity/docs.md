## 596. BUY UP THE OPPORTUNITY

```txt
1.
Buy up the opportunity,
O Christian, buy today;
For Heaven's ageless mansions buy,
Buy treasures while you may.

Chorus:
Buy up the opportunity,
The souls for when Christ died,
Buy up the opportunity,
Buy for the Crucified.

2.
Buy up the opportunity,
It may not long remain;
The evil hosts are bidding, too,
Those precious souls to gain. 

Chorus:
Buy up the opportunity,
The souls for when Christ died,
Buy up the opportunity,
Buy for the Crucified.


3.
Buy up the opportunity,
Pay any price to win;
With Heaven's legions watching you,
To falter will be sin. 

Chorus:
Buy up the opportunity,
The souls for when Christ died,
Buy up the opportunity,
Buy for the Crucified.


4.
Buy up the opportunity,
At home; in lands afar;
Go quickly!  Find the jewels rare,
Each soul a glowing star. 

Chorus:
Buy up the opportunity,
The souls for when Christ died,
Buy up the opportunity,
Buy for the Crucified.
