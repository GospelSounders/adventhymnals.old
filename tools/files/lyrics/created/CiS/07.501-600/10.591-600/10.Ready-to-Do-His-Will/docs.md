## 600. READY TO DO HIS WILL

```txt
1.
Ready to suffer grief or pain,
Ready to stand the test;
Ready to stay at home and send
Others if He sees best.

Chorus:
Ready to go, ready to stay,
Ready my place to fill;
Ready for service, lowly or great,
Ready to do His will.

2.
Ready to go, ready to bear,
Ready to watch and pray;
Ready to stand aside and give,
Till He shall clear the way. 

Chorus:
Ready to go, ready to stay,
Ready my place to fill;
Ready for service, lowly or great,
Ready to do His will.


3.
Ready to speak, ready to think,
Ready with heart and brain;
Ready to work where He sees fit,
Ready to bear the strain. 

Chorus:
Ready to go, ready to stay,
Ready my place to fill;
Ready for service, lowly or great,
Ready to do His will.


4.
Ready to speak, ready to warn,
Ready o'er souls to yearn;
Ready in life, ready in death,
Ready for His return. 

Chorus:
Ready to go, ready to stay,
Ready my place to fill;
Ready for service, lowly or great,
Ready to do His will.
