## 591. COURAGEOUS LIVES

```txt
1.
Father, hear the prayer we offer!
Not for ease that prayer shall be,
But for strength that we may ever
Live our lives courageously.

2.
Not forever by still waters
Would we idly, quiet stay,
But would smite the living fountains
From the rocks along our way.

3.
Be our strength in hours of weakness,
In our wand'rings be our guide;
Thro' endeavor, hardships, danger,
Father, be Thou at our side.

4.
Ours to sow the seed in sorrow,
Thine to bid it spring and grow;
And the golden days of autumn
Will a precious harvest show.
