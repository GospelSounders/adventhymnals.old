## 597. HOW MUCH I NEED THEE

```txt
1.
Blessed Lord, how much I need thee!
Weak and sinful, poor and blind;
Take my trembling hand and lead me,
Strength and sight in thee I find.

Refrain:
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Blessed Lord, how much I need thee!
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Saviour, keep me ev'ry hour.

2.
Clothe me with thy robe of meekness,
Stained with sin this robe of mine;
Teach me first to feel my weakness,
Then to plead for strength divine. 

Refrain:
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Blessed Lord, how much I need thee!
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Saviour, keep me ev'ry hour.


3.
Safe am I if thou dost guide me;
Trusting self, how seen I fall!
Walk life's rugged way be side me,
Thou, my light, my life, my all. 

Refrain:
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Blessed Lord, how much I need thee!
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Saviour, keep me ev'ry hour.


4.
Then what e'er the future bringeth,
Smiles of joy or tears of grief,
Still to thee my spirit clingeth,
Thou art still my soul's relief. 

Refrain:
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Blessed Lord, how much I need thee!
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Saviour, keep me ev'ry hour.
