Be with us, Lord, as forth we go,
Winning precious souls to Thee;
And make our love and zeal to glow,
Winning precious souls to Thee.

Chorus:
Winning precious souls, many precious souls,
Jewels in Thy crown to be;
Help us bring them in from the ways of sin,
Many precious souls to Thee.

Help us to labor faithfully,
Winning precious souls to Thee;
And gather many sheaves for Thee,
Winning precious souls to Thee. 

Chorus:
Winning precious souls, many precious souls,
Jewels in Thy crown to be;
Help us bring them in from the ways of sin,
Many precious souls to Thee.

We toil with feeble hands and weak,
Winning precious souls to thee;
To us new faith and courage speak,
Winning precious souls to thee. 

Chorus:
Winning precious souls, many precious souls,
Jewels in Thy crown to be;
Help us bring them in from the ways of sin,
Many precious souls to Thee.

As we each day our work pursue,
Winning precious souls to Thee;
Our faith increase, our zeal renew,
Winning precious souls to Thee. 

Chorus:
Winning precious souls, many precious souls,
Jewels in Thy crown to be;
Help us bring them in from the ways of sin,
Many precious souls to Thee.

We need Thy help, O gracious Lord!
Winning precious souls to Thee;
Go with us, and Thy aid afford,
Winning precious souls to Thee.

Winning precious souls, many precious souls,

Help us bring them in from the ways of sin,
Many precious souls to Thee.

As we go forth in trust and love,
Winning precious souls to Thee;
Send down Thy blessing from above,
Winning precious souls to Thee.

Winning precious souls, many precious souls,
Jewels in Thy crown to be;
Help us bring them in from the ways of sin,
Many precious souls to Thee.
