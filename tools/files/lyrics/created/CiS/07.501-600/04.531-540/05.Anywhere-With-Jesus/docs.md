## 535. ANYWHERE WITH JESUS

```txt
1.
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,
Anywhere he leads me in this world below;
Anywhere without him, dearest joys would fade,
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.

Chorus:
Anywhere!  anywhere! 
Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.

2.
Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone,
Other friends may fail me, he is still my own;
Tho' his hand may lead me over dreary ways,
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise. 

Chorus:
Anywhere!  anywhere! 
Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.


3.
Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
When the gloomy shadows round about me creep,
Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;
Anywhere with Jesus will be home sweet home. 

Chorus:
Anywhere!  anywhere! 
Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.
