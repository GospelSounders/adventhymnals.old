## 537. "EVEN UNTO THE END"

```txt
1.
"Go ye into all the world,
And preach the gospel to ev'ry creature,"
Let my banner be unfurled,
With pen, and song, and the living teacher.

Chorus:
"Even unto the end,
Even unto the end;"
"Lo, I am with you alway,
Even unto the end."

2.
Millions bless'd with gospel light,
Yet need the gladness of sins forgiven;
Millions, cursed with heathen night,
Yet long to know of the Way to heaven. 

Chorus:
"Even unto the end,
Even unto the end;"
"Lo, I am with you alway,
Even unto the end."


3.
Stand not idle all the day,
Because no man hath declared thy wages;
Work on, love demands no pay,
'Tis all set down in the heav'nly pages. 

Chorus:
"Even unto the end,
Even unto the end;"
"Lo, I am with you alway,
Even unto the end."


4.
All things on the altar lay,
Let Calvry's cross be thy only glory;
Cast all selfish fear away,
Begin just now telling love's sweet story. 

Chorus:
"Even unto the end,
Even unto the end;"
"Lo, I am with you alway,
Even unto the end."
