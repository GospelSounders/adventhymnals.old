## 533. FREELY GIVE

```txt
1.
Would you win a Saviour's blessing?
Freely, freely give;
Would you see his work progressing?
Freely, freely give;
Let your souls with love expand,
Open wide a liberal hand;
Would you follow God's command?
Freely, freely give.

2.
With a cheerful heart and willing,
Freely, freely give;
Like the dew its balm distilling,
Freely, freely give;
Have you little?  Give your mite;
O how precious in his sight!
He your off'ring will requite;
Freely, freely give.

3.
Give to spread the grand Old Story,
Freely, freely give;
Give to speed the light of glory,
Freely, freely give;
Would you gain a rich reward
In the harvest of the Lord?
Then obedient to his word,
Freely, freely give.
