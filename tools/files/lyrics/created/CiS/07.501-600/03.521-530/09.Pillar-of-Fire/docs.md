## 529. PILLAR OF FIRE

```txt
1.
The angel of the Lord encampeth
Round about us, round about us;
Round about the souls that fear him,
Night and day.

Chorus:
O pillar of fire, pillar of cloud,
Lead me, lead me ev'ry day!
O pillar of fire, pillar of cloud,
Lead me on my heav'nly way.

2.
When danger hovers o'er our pathway,
He will hide us, he will hide us,
Safe within the mighty shadow 
Of his wing. 

Chorus:
O pillar of fire, pillar of cloud,
Lead me, lead me ev'ry day!
O pillar of fire, pillar of cloud,
Lead me on my heav'nly way.


3.
We'll trust thee as we onward journey,
God of Israel, God of Israel,
Till we reach the land of promise,
Just before. 

Chorus:
O pillar of fire, pillar of cloud,
Lead me, lead me ev'ry day!
O pillar of fire, pillar of cloud,
Lead me on my heav'nly way.
