## 550. PRAY FOR THE ERRING

```txt
1.
Pray for the erring ones, faith shall reclaim them;
Doubt not the promises, plead them in prayer.
Loving and merciful, Jesus will save them;
Up to the mercy seat thy loved ones bear.

Refrain:
Always pray, pray for the erring;
Pray in faith, Jesus will hear;
Always pray, pray for the erring;
Prayer brings the wand'rers near.

2.
Plead with them tenderly, point them to Jesus;
Tho' justly sorrowing, do not despair.
Kneel in the darkest hour, firmly believing;
On Christ the crucified cast all your care. 

Refrain:
Always pray, pray for the erring;
Pray in faith, Jesus will hear;
Always pray, pray for the erring;
Prayer brings the wand'rers near.


3.
Let thine example be worthy thy calling,
Thy life is witnessing each day and hour.
Thousands now perishing long for a Saviour;
Show forth his wondrous love, tell of his power. 

Refrain:
Always pray, pray for the erring;
Pray in faith, Jesus will hear;
Always pray, pray for the erring;
Prayer brings the wand'rers near.


4.
Walk with the Perfect One, choosing none other;
His robe of righteousness joyfully wear;
So shall the erring see beauty in Jesus,
So shall the Father hear and grant thy prayer. 

Refrain:
Always pray, pray for the erring;
Pray in faith, Jesus will hear;
Always pray, pray for the erring;
Prayer brings the wand'rers near.
