## 579. I'LL BE A SUNBEAM

```txt
1.
If I were a sunbeam,
This is what I'd do,
I'd find the dark places,
Searching the forest through;
I would kiss the pale flowers,
Bending low at my feet,
Till each lonely blossom
Open'd fair and sweet.

Chorus:
Beautiful sunbeam!
God sent you here;
I'll be a sunbeam,
Lonely hearts to cheer.

2.
So many dark places
In this world of sin,
Why not be a sunbeam,
Letting the love light in,
God's beautiful love light,
Smiles and words of cheer;
Kindness is the sunshine
We should scatter here. 

Chorus:
Beautiful sunbeam!
God sent you here;
I'll be a sunbeam,
Lonely hearts to cheer.


3.
If we are like Jesus
Sun of Righteousness
Who left the bright mansions,
Lonely lives to bless,
'Twill be sweetest pleasure
Of his love to tell,
Shining out his gladness
Where the sad ones dwell. 

Chorus:
Beautiful sunbeam!
God sent you here;
I'll be a sunbeam,
Lonely hearts to cheer.
