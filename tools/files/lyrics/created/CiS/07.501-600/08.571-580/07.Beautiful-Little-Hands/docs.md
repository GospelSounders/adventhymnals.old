## 577. BEAUTIFUL LITTLE HANDS

```txt
1.
Beautiful the little hands
That fulfill the Lord's commands;
Beautiful the little eyes,
Kindled with light from the skies.

Chorus:
Beautiful, beautiful, are the hands
That fulfill the Lord's commands;
Beautiful, beautiful, are the eyes,
Kindled with light from the skies.

2.
All the little hands were made
Jesus precious cause to aid;
All the little hearts to beat 
Warm in his service so sweet. 

Chorus:
Beautiful, beautiful, are the hands
That fulfill the Lord's commands;
Beautiful, beautiful, are the eyes,
Kindled with light from the skies.


3.
All the little lips should pray
To the Saviour ev'ry day;
All the little feet should go
Swift on his errands below. 

Chorus:
Beautiful, beautiful, are the hands
That fulfill the Lord's commands;
Beautiful, beautiful, are the eyes,
Kindled with light from the skies.


4.
What your little hands can do,
That the Lord intends for you;
Make that thing your first delight,
Do it for him with your might. 

Chorus:
Beautiful, beautiful, are the hands
That fulfill the Lord's commands;
Beautiful, beautiful, are the eyes,
Kindled with light from the skies.
