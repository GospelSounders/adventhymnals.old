## 509. STAND ON THE ROCK

```txt
1.
Firmly stand for God, in the world's mad strife,
Tho' the bleak winds roar, and the waves beat high;
'Tis the Rock alone giveth strength and life,
When the hosts of sin are nigh.

Chorus:
Let us stand on the Rock,
Firmly stand on the Rock,
On the Rock of Christ alone;
If the strife we endure,
We shall stand secure,
'Mid the throng who surround the throne.

2.
Firmly stand for Right, with a motive pure,
With a true heart bold, and a faith e'er strong;
'Tis the Rock alone giveth triumph sure,
O'er the world's array of wrong. 

Chorus:
Let us stand on the Rock,
Firmly stand on the Rock,
On the Rock of Christ alone;
If the strife we endure,
We shall stand secure,
'Mid the throng who surround the throne.


3.
Firmly stand for Truth, it will serve you best;
Tho' it waiteth long, it is sure at last;
'Tis the Rock alone giveth peace and rest,
When the storms of life are past. 

Chorus:
Let us stand on the Rock,
Firmly stand on the Rock,
On the Rock of Christ alone;
If the strife we endure,
We shall stand secure,
'Mid the throng who surround the throne.
