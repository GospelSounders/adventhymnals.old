## 505. A SHELTER IN THE TIME OF STORM

```txt
1.
The Lord's our Rock, in him we hide,
A shelter in the time of storm;
Secure whatever may betide,
A shelter in the time of storm.

Chorus:
Mighty Rock in a weary land,
Cooling Shade on the burning sand,
Faithful Guide for the pilgrim band,
A shelter in the time of storm.

2.
A shade by day, defence by night,
A shelter in the time of storm;
No fears alarm, no foes affright,
A shelter in the time of storm. 

Chorus:
Mighty Rock in a weary land,
Cooling Shade on the burning sand,
Faithful Guide for the pilgrim band,
A shelter in the time of storm.


3.
The raging floods may round us beat,
A shelter in the time of storm;
We find in God a safe retreat,
A shelter in the time of storm. 

Chorus:
Mighty Rock in a weary land,
Cooling Shade on the burning sand,
Faithful Guide for the pilgrim band,
A shelter in the time of storm.


4.
O Rock divine, O Refuge dear,
A shelter in the time of storm;
Be thou our helper, ever near,
A shelter in the time of storm. 

Chorus:
Mighty Rock in a weary land,
Cooling Shade on the burning sand,
Faithful Guide for the pilgrim band,
A shelter in the time of storm.
