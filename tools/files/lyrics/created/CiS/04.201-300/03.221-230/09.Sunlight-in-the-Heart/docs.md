## 229. SUNLIGHT IN THE HEART

```txt
1.
There is sunlight on the hilltop,
There is sunlight on the sea,
And the golden beams are sleeping,
On the soft and verdant lea;
But a richer light is filling
All the chambers of my heart;
For thou dwellest there my Saviour,
And 'tis sunlight where thou art.

Refrain:
O the sunlight!  beautiful sunlight!
O the sunlight in the heart!
Jesus' smile can banish sadness;
It is sunlight in the heart.

2.
In the dust I leave my sadness,
As the garb of other days,
For thou robest me with gladness,
And thou fillest me with praise;
And to that bright home of glory
Which thy love hath won for me,
In my heart and mind ascending,
My glad spirit follows thee. 

Refrain:
O the sunlight!  beautiful sunlight!
O the sunlight in the heart!
Jesus' smile can banish sadness;
It is sunlight in the heart.


3.
Loving Saviour, thou hast bought me,
And my life, my all, is thine;
Let the lamp thy love hath lighted
To thy praise and glory shine;
And to that bright home of glory
Which thy love hath won for me,
In my heart and mind ascending,
My glad spirit follows thee.

Refrain:
O the sunlight!  beautiful sunlight!
O the sunlight in the heart!
Jesus' smile can banish sadness;
It is sunlight in the heart.
