## 223. NOR SILVER NOR GOLD

```txt
1.
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
No riches of earth Could have saved my poor soul;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Saviour now maketh me whole.

Chorus:
I am redeemed, but not with silver,
I am bought but not with gold;
Bought with a price the blood of Jesus,
Precious price of love untold!

2.
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
The guilt on my conscience too heavy had grown;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Saviour could only atone. 

Chorus:
I am redeemed, but not with silver,
I am bought but not with gold;
Bought with a price the blood of Jesus,
Precious price of love untold!


3.
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
The holy commandment forbade me draw near,
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Saviour removeth my fear. 

Chorus:
I am redeemed, but not with silver,
I am bought but not with gold;
Bought with a price the blood of Jesus,
Precious price of love untold!


4.
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
The way into heaven could not thus be bought;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Saviour redemption hath wrought. 

Chorus:
I am redeemed, but not with silver,
I am bought but not with gold;
Bought with a price the blood of Jesus,
Precious price of love untold!
