## 227. WAKE THE SONG OF JOY AND GLADNESS

```txt
1.
Wake the song of joy and gladness,
Hither bring your noblest lays;
Banish ev'ry tho't of sadness,
Pouring forth your highest praise,
Sing to him whose care has brought us
Once again with friends to meet,
And whose loving voice has taught us
Of the way to Jesus' feet.

Refrain:
Wake the song, wake the Song,
the song of joy and gladness,
Wake the song, wake the song,
The song of jubilee.

2.
Joyfully with songs and banners,
We will greet the festal day;
Shout aloud our glad hosannas,
And our grateful homage pay.
We will change our Saviour's glory
While our tho'ts we raise above,
Telling still "the old, old story,"
Precious theme Redeeming love! 

Refrain:
Wake the song, wake the Song,
the song of joy and gladness,
Wake the song, wake the song,
The song of jubilee.


3.
Thanks to thee, O holy Father, 
For the mercies of the year;
May each heart, as here we gather,
Swell with gratitude sincere,
Thanks to thee, O loving Saviour,
For redemption thro' thy blood:
Breathe upon us, Holy Spirit,
Sweetly draw us near to God. 

Refrain:
Wake the song, wake the Song,
the song of joy and gladness,
Wake the song, wake the song,
The song of jubilee.
