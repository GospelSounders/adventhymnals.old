## 289. NEAR THE CROSS

```txt
1.
Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain
Free to all, a healing stream,
Flows from Calv'ry's mountain.

Chorus:
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptur'd soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

2.
Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me. 

Chorus:
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptur'd soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.


3.
Near the cross!  O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o'er me. 

Chorus:
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptur'd soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.


4.
Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever;
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river. 

Chorus:
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever;
Till my raptur'd soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.
