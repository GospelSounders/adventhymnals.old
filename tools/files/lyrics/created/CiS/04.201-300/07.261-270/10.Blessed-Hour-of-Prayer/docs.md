## 270. BLESSED HOUR OF PRAYER

```txt
1.
'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,
And we gather to Jesus, our Saviour and Friend;
If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,
What a balm for the weary!  O how sweet to be there!

Chorus:  Blessed hour of prayer,
Blessed hour of prayer,
What a balm for the weary!
O how sweet to be there!

2.
'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Saviour draws near,
With a tender compassion His children to hear;
When He tells us we may cast at His feet ev'ry care,
What a balm for the weary!  O how sweet to be there! 

Chorus:  Blessed hour of prayer,
Blessed hour of prayer,
What a balm for the weary!
O how sweet to be there!


3.
'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried
To the Saviour who loves them their sorrows confide;
With a sympathizing heart He removes ev'ry care;
What a balm for the weary!  O how sweet to be there! 

Chorus:  Blessed hour of prayer,
Blessed hour of prayer,
What a balm for the weary!
O how sweet to be there!


4.
At the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe
That the blessings we're needing we'll surely receive,
In the fulness of this trust we shall lose ev'ry care;
What a balm for the weary!  O how sweet to be there! 

Chorus:  Blessed hour of prayer,
Blessed hour of prayer,
What a balm for the weary!
O how sweet to be there!
