## 291. I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVES

```txt
1.
"I know that my Redeemer lives,"
And ever prays for me;
A token of His love He gives,
A pledge of liberty.

2.
He lives all glorious in the sky,
He lives who once was dead;
He lives exalted there on high,
My everlasting Head.

3.
He lives, triumphant o'er the grave,
And while He lives I'll sing;
He lives eternally to save,
My Prophet, Priest and King.

4.
He lives, my mansion to prepare,
My Jesus, still the same;
He lives to bring me safely there,
All glory to His name.
