## 256. OUR KING

```txt
1.
Our sweetest songs of gladness,
On this delightful day,
We bring to praise the Saviour,
Who is the Life, the Way.

Chorus:
We sing, we sing
The praises of our King,
We sing, we sing
The glory of our King.

2.
He lov'd the little children,
When he was here below,
And tho' he's up in heaven,
He loves us yet we know. 

Chorus:
We sing, we sing
The praises of our King,
We sing, we sing
The glory of our King.


3.
We love to sing his praises
And hear the stories told,
Of him when he was dwelling
In Galilee of old. 

Chorus:
We sing, we sing
The praises of our King,
We sing, we sing
The glory of our King.


4.
O Saviour, blessed Saviour,
We kneel, before thy throne,
And ask that thou wilt help us
To live for thee alone. 

Chorus:
We sing, we sing
The praises of our King,
We sing, we sing
The glory of our King.
