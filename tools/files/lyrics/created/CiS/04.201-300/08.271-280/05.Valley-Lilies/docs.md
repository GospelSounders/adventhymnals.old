## 275. VALLEY LILIES

```txt
1.
Valley lilies, meek and lowly,
Let me hear your message sweet,
Tell of Christ the pure and holy,
Bending as to touch His feet.

Refrain:
Snowy lilies of the valley,
Speak again your message rare;
Testify to me of Jesus,
Heaven's Lily, wondrous fair!

2.
Valley lilies, golden hearted,
Love's sweet mission you fulfill,
For you tell in perfumed language,
How he wrought his Father's will. 

Refrain:
Snowy lilies of the valley,
Speak again your message rare;
Testify to me of Jesus,
Heaven's Lily, wondrous fair!


3.
Valley lilies, cups inverted,
Still the Master you proclaim:
Empty of all pomp and glory,
To redeem the world He came. 

Refrain:
Snowy lilies of the valley,
Speak again your message rare;
Testify to me of Jesus,
Heaven's Lily, wondrous fair!
