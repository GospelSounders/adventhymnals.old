## 279. GOD OF LIFE AND LIGHT

```txt
1.
God of life and God of light,
Robed in all Thy glory might,
Shed upon us from above
Beams of Thine abiding love.
Bless us with Thy peace today,
While within Thy courts we stay.

2.
God of good and God of grace,
Show again Thy radiant face,
As in Jesus long ago
Thou Thyself to earth didst show.
Bless us with Thy peace today,
While within Thy courts we stay.

3.
God of each and God of all,
Low before Thy feet we fall,
Take the gifts of love we bring;
Hear us as Thy praise we sing.
Bless us with Thy peace today,
While within Thy courts we stay.

4.
Thou our years of toil hast blest,
Ever given what was best;
May the future hold in store
Cups of service running o'er.
Bless us with Thy peace today,
While within Thy courts we stay.
