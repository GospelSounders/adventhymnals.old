## 215. THE NAME OF JESUS

```txt
1.
The name of Jesus is so sweet,
I know its music to repeat;
It makes my joys full and complete,
The precious name of Jesus.

Chorus:
"Jesus," oh, how sweet the name!
"Jesus," ev'ry day the same;
"Jesus," let all saints proclaim
Its worthy praise forever.

2.
I love the name of Him whose heart
Knows all my griefs and bears a part;
Who bids all anxious fears depart
I love the name of Jesus. 

Chorus:
"Jesus," oh, how sweet the name!
"Jesus," ev'ry day the same;
"Jesus," let all saints proclaim
Its worthy praise forever.


3.
That name I fondly love to hear,
It never fails my heart to cheer,
Its music dries the falling tears;
Exalt the name of Jesus. 

Chorus:
"Jesus," oh, how sweet the name!
"Jesus," ev'ry day the same;
"Jesus," let all saints proclaim
Its worthy praise forever.


4.
No word of man can ever tell
How sweet the name I love so well;
Oh, let its praise ever swell,
Oh, praise the name of Jesus. 

Chorus:
"Jesus," oh, how sweet the name!
"Jesus," ev'ry day the same;
"Jesus," let all saints proclaim
Its worthy praise forever.
