## 105. SING TO THE GREAT JEHOVAH`S PRAISE

```txt
1.
Sing to the great Jehovah’s praise!
All praise to Him belongs;
Who kindly lengthens out our days,
In spires our choicest songs,
Inspires our choicest songs.

2.
His providence hath brought us through
Another various year;
We all, with vows and anthems new,
Before our God appear,
Before our God appear.

3.
O God, Thy mercies past we own,
And Thy continued care;
To Thee presenting through Thy Son
What e’er we have and are,
What e’er we have and are.
```
