## 115. O COME, O COME, IMMANUEL

```txt
1.
O come, O come, Emmanuel,
And ransom captive Israel,
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.


Refrain:
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee,
O Israel.


2.
O come, Thou Wisdom from on high,
And order all things far and night;
To us the path of knowledge show,
And cause us in her ways to go.


Refrain:
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee,
O Israel.

3.
O come, Desire of nations, bind
In one the hearts of all mankind;
Bid Thou our sad divisions cease,
And be Thyself our King of Peace.

Refrain:
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee,
O Israel.
