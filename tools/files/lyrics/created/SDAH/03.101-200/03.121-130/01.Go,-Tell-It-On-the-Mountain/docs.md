## 121. GO, TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN

```txt
1.
While shepherds kept their watching
O’er silent flocks by night,
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light.

2.
The shepherds feared and trembled
When lo! Above the earth
Rang out the angel chorus
That hailed our Savior’s birth.

3.
Down in a lowly manger
The humble Christ was born,
And brought us God’s salvation
That blessed Christmas morn.
