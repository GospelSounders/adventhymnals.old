## 151. JESUS WALKED THIS LONESOME VALLEY

```txt
1.
Jesus walked this lonesome valley;
He had to walk it by Himself.
O nobody else could walk it for Him.
He had to walk it by Himself.

2.
I must go and stand my trial.
I have to stand it by myself.
O nobody else could stand it for me.
I have to stand it by myself.

3.
Jesus walked this lonesome valley;
He had to walk it by Himself.
O nobody else could walk it for Him.
He had to walk it by Himself.
