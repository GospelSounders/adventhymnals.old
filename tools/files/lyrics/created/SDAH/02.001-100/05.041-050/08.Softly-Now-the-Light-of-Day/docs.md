## 48. SOFTLY NOW THE LIGHT OF DAY

```txt
1.
Softly now the light of day
Fades upon out sight away:
Free from care, from labor free,
Lord, we would commune with Thee.

2.
Thou, whose allpervading eye
Nought escapes, without, within,
Pardon each infirmity,
Open fault, and secret sin.

3.
Soon from us the light of day
Shall forever pass away;
Then, from sin and sorrow free,
Take us, Lord, to dwell with Thee.
```
