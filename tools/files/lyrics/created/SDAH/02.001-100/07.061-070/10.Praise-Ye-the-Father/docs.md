## 70. PRAISE YE THE FATHER

```txt
1.
Praise ye the Father for His loving kindness,
Tenderly cares He for His erring children;
Praise Him, ye angels, praise Him in the heavens;
Praise ye Jehovah!

2.
Praise ye the Savior, great is the compassion,
Graciously cares He for His chosen people;
Young men and maidens, ye old men and children,
Praise ye the Savior!

3.
Praise ye the Spirit, comforter of Israel,
Sent of the Father and the Son to bless us;
Praise ye the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
Praise the Eternal Three!
