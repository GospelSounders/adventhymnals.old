## 64. LORD, DISMISS US WITH THY BLESSING

```txt
1.
Lord, dismiss us with thy blessing;
fill our hearts with joy and peace;
let us each, thy love possessing,
triumph in redeeming grace.
O refresh us, O refresh us,
traveling through this wilderness.

2.
Thanks we give and adoration
for thy gospelâ€™s joyful sound.
May the fruits of thy salvation
in our hearts and lives abound;
ever faithful, ever faithful
to the truth may we be found.
```
