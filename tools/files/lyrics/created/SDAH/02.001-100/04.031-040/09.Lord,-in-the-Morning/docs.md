## 39. LORD, IN THE MORNING

```txt
1.
Lord, in the morning Thou shalt hear
My voice ascending high;
To Thee will I direct my prayer,
To Thee lift up mine eye-

2.
Up to the hills where Christ is gone
To plead for all His saints,
Presenting at His Fatherâ€™s throne
Our songs and our complaints.

3.
O may Thy Spirit guide my feet
In ways of righteousness;
Make every path of duty straight
And plain before my face.
4 The men that love and fear Thy name
Shall see their hopes fulfilled;
The mighty God will compass them
With favor as a shield.
```
