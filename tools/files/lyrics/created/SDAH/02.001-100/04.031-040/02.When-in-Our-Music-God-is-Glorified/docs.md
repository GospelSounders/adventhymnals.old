## 32. WHEN IN OUR MUSIC GOD IS GLORIFIED

```txt
1.
When in our music God is glorified,
And adoration leaves no room for pride,
It is as though the whole creation cried:
Alleluia!

2.
How oft, in making music, we have found
A new dimension in the world of sound,
As worship moved us to a more profound
Alleluia!

3.
And did not Jesus sing a psalm that night
When utmost evil strove against the light?
Then let us sing for whom He won the fight:
Alleluia!

4.
Let every instrument be used for praise;
Let all rejoice who have a voice to raise;
And may God give us faith to sing always:
Alleluia!
