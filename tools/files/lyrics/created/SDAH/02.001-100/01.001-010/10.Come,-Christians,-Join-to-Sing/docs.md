## 10. COME, CHRISTIANS, JOIN TO SING

```txt
1.
Come, Christians, join to sing,
Alleluia! Amen!
Loud praise to Christ our King;
Alleluia! Amen!
Let all, with heart and voice,
Before His throne rejoice;
Praise is His gracious choice:
Alleluia! Amen!

2.
Come, lift your hearts on high;
Alleluia! Amen!
Let praises fill the sky;
Alleluia! Amen!
He is our Guide and Friend;
To us He’ll condescend;
His love shall never end:
Alleluia! Amen!

3.
Praise yet our Christ again;
Alleluia! Amen!
Life shall not end the strain;
Alleluia! Amen!
On heaven’s blissful shore
His goodness we’ll adore,
Singing forevermore,
Alleluia! Amen!
