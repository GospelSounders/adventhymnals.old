## 201. CHRIST IS COMING

```txt
1.
Christ is coming! let creation
Bid her groans and travail cease;
Let the glorious proclamation
Hope restore and faith increase;
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!
(Prince of Peace!)
Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!

2.
Earth can now but tell the story
Of Thy bitter cross and pain;
She shall yet behold Thy glory
When Thou comest back to reign;
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Let each heart repeat the strain.
(repeat the strain)
Let each heart repeat the strain.

3.
With that “blessed hope” before us,
Let no harp remain unstrung;
Let the mighty advent chorus
Onward roll from tongue to tongue:
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
(quickly come!)
Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
