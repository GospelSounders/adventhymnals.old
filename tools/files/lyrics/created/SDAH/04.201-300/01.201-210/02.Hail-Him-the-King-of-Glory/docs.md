## 202. HAIL HIM THE KING OF GLORY

```txt
1.
Tell it to every kindred and nation,
Tell it far and near;
Earth’s darkest night will fade with the dawning,
Jesus will soon appear.


Refrain:
Hail Him the King of glory,
Once the Lamb for sinners slain;
Tell, tell the wondrous story,
“Jesus comes to reign.”


2.
Nations again in strife and commotion,
Warnings by the way;
Signs in the heavens, unerring omens,
Herald the glorious day.


Refrain:
Hail Him the King of glory,
Once the Lamb for sinners slain;
Tell, tell the wondrous story,
“Jesus comes to reign.”

3.
Children of God look up with rejoicing;
Shout and sing His praise;
Blessèd are they who, waiting and watching,
Look for the dawning rays.

Refrain:
Hail Him the King of glory,
Once the Lamb for sinners slain;
Tell, tell the wondrous story,
“Jesus comes to reign.”
