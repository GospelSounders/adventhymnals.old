## 265. BREATHE ON ME, BREATH OF GOD

```txt
1.
Breathe on me, breath of God,
Fill me with life anew,
That I may love what Thou dost love,
And do what Thou wouldst do.

2.
Breathe on me, breath of God,
Until my heart is pure,
Until with Thee I will one will,
To do and to endure.

3.
Breathe on me, breath of God,
Till I am wholly Thine,
Until this earthly part of me
Glows with Thy fire divine.

4.
Breathe on me, breath of God,
So shall I constant be,
And live with Thee the perfect life
Of Thine eternity.
