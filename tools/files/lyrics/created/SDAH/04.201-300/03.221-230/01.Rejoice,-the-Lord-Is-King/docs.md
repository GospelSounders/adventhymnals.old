## 221. REJOICE, THE LORD IS KING

```txt
1.
Rejoice, the Lord is King! Your Lord and King adore!
Rejoice, give thanks, and sing and triumph evermore
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!

2.
Jesus, the Savior, reigns, The God of truth and love;
When He had purged our stains, He took His seat above
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!

3.
His kingdom cannot fail, He rules oâ€™er earth and heaven
The keys of death and grave Are to our Jesus given
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!

4.
Rejoice in glorious hope! Our Lord the judge shall come,
And take His servants up To their eternal home
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!
