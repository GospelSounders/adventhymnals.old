## 358. FAR AND NEAR THE FIELDS ARE TEEMING

```txt
1.
Far and near the fields are teeming
with the sheaves of ripened grain;
Far and near their gold is gleaming
O’er the summy slope and plain.


Refrain:
Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!
Hear us Lord,to Thee we cry;
Send them now the sheaves to gather,
Ere the harvest-time pass by.


2.
Send them forth with morn’s first beaming,
Send them in the noon-tides’s glare;
When the sun’s last rays are streaming,
bid them gather everywhere.


Refrain:
Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!
Hear us Lord,to Thee we cry;
Send them now the sheaves to gather,
Ere the harvest-time pass by.

3.
O thou, whom thy Lord is sending,
gather now the sheaves of gold;
Heavenward then at evening wending
Thou shalt come with joy untold.

Refrain:
Lord of harvest, send forth reapers!
Hear us Lord,to Thee we cry;
Send them now the sheaves to gather,
Ere the harvest-time pass by.
