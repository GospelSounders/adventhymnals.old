## 389. LIGHT OF LIGHT, ENLIGHTEN ME

```txt
1.
Light of light, enlighten me,
Now anew the day is dawning;
Sun of grace, the shadows flee;
Brighten Thou my Sabbath morning;
With Thy joyous sunshine blest,
Happy is my day of rest.

2.
Let me with my heart today,
Holy, holy, holy, singing,
Rapt awhile from earth away,
All my soul to Thee up springing,
Have a foretaste inward given
How they worship Thee in heaven.

3.
Hence all care, all vanity!
For the day to God is holy;
Come, Thou glorious Majesty,
Deign to fill this temple lowly;
Nought today my soul shall move,
Simply resting in Thy love.
