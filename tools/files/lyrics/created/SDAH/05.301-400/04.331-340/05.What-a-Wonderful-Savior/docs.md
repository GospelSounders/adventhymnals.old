1.
Christ has for sin atonement made,
What a wonderful Saviour!
We are redeemed! the price is paid!
What a wonderful Savior!


Refrain:
What a wonderful Savior
is Jesus, my Jesus!
What a wonderful Savior
is Jesus, my Lord!


2.
I praise Him for the cleansing blood,
What a wonderful Saviour!
That reconciled my soul to God;
What a wonderful Saviour!


Refrain:
What a wonderful Savior
is Jesus, my Jesus!
What a wonderful Savior
is Jesus, my Lord!

3.
He walks beside me all the way,
What a wonderful Saviour!
And keeps me faithful day by day;
What a wonderful Saviour!


Refrain:
What a wonderful Savior
is Jesus, my Jesus!
What a wonderful Savior
is Jesus, my Lord!

He gives me overcoming power,
What a wonderful Saviour!
And triumph in each trying hour;
What a wonderful Saviour!

What a wonderful Savior
is Jesus, my Jesus!
What a wonderful Savior
is Jesus, my Lord!
