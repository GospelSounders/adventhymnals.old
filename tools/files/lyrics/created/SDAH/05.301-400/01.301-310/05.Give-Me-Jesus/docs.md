1.
In the morning, when I rise
In the morning, when I rise
In the morning, when I rise


Refrain:
Give me Jesus.
Give me Jesus,
Give me Jesus.
You can have all this world,
Just give me Jesus.


2.
Dark mid-night was my cry,
Dark mid-night was my cry,
Dark midnight was my cry,
Give me Jesus.


Refrain:
Give me Jesus.
Give me Jesus,
Give me Jesus.
You can have all this world,
Just give me Jesus.

3.
Just about the break of day,
Just about the break of day,
Just about the break of day,
Give me Jesus.

Give me Jesus.
Give me Jesus,
Give me Jesus.
You can have all this world,
Just give me Jesus.

Oh, when I come to die,
Oh, when I come to die,
Oh, when I come to die,
Give me Jesus.

Give me Jesus.
Give me Jesus,
Give me Jesus.
You can have all this world,
Just give me Jesus.
