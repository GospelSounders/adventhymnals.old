## 659. MAY THE GRACE OF CHRIST OUR SAVIOR

```txt
1.
May the grace of Christ our Savior
And the Father’s boundless love,
With the Holy Spirit’s favor,
Rest upon them from above.

2.
Thus may they abide in union
With each other and the Lord,
And possess, in sweet communion,
Joys which earth cannot afford.
```
