## 426. I SHALL SEE THE KING

```txt
1.
I shall see the King where the angels sing,
I shall see the King some day, in the better land,
On that golden strand,
And with Him shall ever stay.


Refrain:
In His glory, I shall see the King,
And forever endless praises sing;
‘Twas on Calvary Jesus died for me;
I shall see the King someday.


2.
In the land of song, in the glory throng,
Where there never comes a night,
With my Lord once slain I shall ever reign
In the glory land of light.


Refrain:
In His glory, I shall see the King,
And forever endless praises sing;
‘Twas on Calvary Jesus died for me;
I shall see the King someday.

3.
I shall see the King, all my tributes bring,
And shall look upon His face;
Then my song shall be how He ransomed me
And has kept me by His grace.

Refrain:
In His glory, I shall see the King,
And forever endless praises sing;
‘Twas on Calvary Jesus died for me;
I shall see the King someday.
