## 475. BALM IN GILEAD

```txt
1.
There is a balm in Gilead
To make the wounded whole;
There is a balm in Gilead
To heal the sin-sick soul.

2.
Sometimes I feel discouraged,
And think my workâ€™s in vain,
But then the Holy Spirit
Revives my soul again.

3.
If you can not preach like Peter,
If you can not pray like Paul,
You can tell the love of Jesus,
And say He died for all.
