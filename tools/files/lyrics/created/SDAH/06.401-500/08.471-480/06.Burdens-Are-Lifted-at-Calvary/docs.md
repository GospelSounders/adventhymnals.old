## 476. BURDENS ARE LIFTED AT CALVARY

```txt
1.
Days are filled with sorrow and care,
Hearts are lonely and drear;
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Jesus is very near.


Refrain:
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Calvary, Calvary,
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Jesus is very near.


2.
Cast your care on Jesus today,
Leave your worry and fear;
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Jesus is very near.


Refrain:
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Calvary, Calvary,
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Jesus is very near.

3.
Troubled soul, the Saviour can see,
Evâ€™ry heartache and tear;
Burdens are lifted at Calvary
Jesus is very near.

Refrain:
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Calvary, Calvary,
Burdens are lifted at Calvary,
Jesus is very near.
