## 548. NOW PRAISE THE HIDDEN GOD OF LOVE

```txt
1.
Now praise the hidden God of love
In whom we all must live and move,
Who shepherds us, at every stage
Thro’ youth, maturity, and age.

2.
Who challenged us, when were young
To storm the citadels of wrong;
In care for others taught us how
God’s true community must grow.

3.
Who bids us never lose our zest,
Tho’ age is urging us to rest,
But proves to us that we have still
A work to do, a place to fill.

4.
Then talk no more of wasted time,
But Godward look, and upward climb,
Content to sleep, when day is done,
And rise refreshed, and travel on.
```
