## 569. PASS ME NOT, O GENTLE SAVIOR

```txt
1.
Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
hear my humble cry;
while on others thou art calling,
do not pass me by.


Refrain:
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
while on others thou art calling,
do not pass me by.


2.
Let me at thy throne of mercy
find a sweet relief,
kneeling there in deep contrition;
help my unbelief.


Refrain:
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
while on others thou art calling,
do not pass me by.

3.
Trusting only in thy merit,
would I seek thy face;
heal my wounded, broken spirit,
save me by thy grace.


Refrain:
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
while on others thou art calling,
do not pass me by.

4.
Thou the spring of all my comfort,
more than life to me,
whom have I on earth beside thee?
Whom in heaven but thee?

Refrain:
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
while on others thou art calling,
do not pass me by.
