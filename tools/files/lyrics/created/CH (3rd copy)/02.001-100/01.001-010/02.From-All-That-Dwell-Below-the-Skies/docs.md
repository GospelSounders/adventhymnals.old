## 2. FROM ALL THAT DWELL BELOW THE SKIES

```txt
1.
From all that dwell below the skies 
Let the Creator's praise arise; 
Let His almighty name be sung 
Through every land, by every tongue.

2.
Eternal are Thy mercies, Lord, 
Eternal truth attends Thy word; 
Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore, 
Till suns shall rise and set no more. 

3.
Your lofty themes, ye mortals, bring, 
In songs of praise divinely sing; 
God's great salvation loud proclaim, 
And shout for joy His glorious name.

4.
In every land begin the song, 
To every land the strains belong; 
In cheerful sounds all voices raise, 
And fill the world with loudest praise.
