## 651. A WONDERFUL SAVIOUR IS JESUS MY LORD

```txt
1.
A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord, 
A wonderful Saviour to me, 
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, 
Where rivers of pleasure I see. 

Refrain:
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock 
That shadows a dry, thirsty land; 
He hideth my life in the depths of His love, 
And covers me there with His hand, 
And covers me there with His hand. 

2.
A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord, 
He taketh my burden away; 
He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved, 
He giveth me strength as my day. 

Refrain:
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock 
That shadows a dry, thirsty land; 
He hideth my life in the depths of His love, 
And covers me there with His hand, 
And covers me there with His hand. 

3.
With numberless blessings each moment He crowns, 
And, filled with His fulness divine, 
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God, 
For such a Redeemer as mine. 

Refrain:
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock 
That shadows a dry, thirsty land; 
He hideth my life in the depths of His love, 
And covers me there with His hand, 
And covers me there with His hand. 

4.
When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise 
To meet Him in clouds of the sky, 
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love, 
I'll shout with the millions on high.

Refrain:
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock 
That shadows a dry, thirsty land; 
He hideth my life in the depths of His love, 
And covers me there with His hand, 
And covers me there with His hand.
