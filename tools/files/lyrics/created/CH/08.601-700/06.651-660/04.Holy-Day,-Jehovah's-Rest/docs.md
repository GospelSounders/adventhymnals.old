## 654. HOLY DAY, JEHOVAH'S REST

```txt
1.
Holy day, Jehovah's rest, 
Of creation's week the best; 
Last of all the chosen seven, 
Blessed of God, to man 'twas given. 

Refrain:
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome; 
Glad we hail its presence blest, 
'Tis the great Jehovah's rest. 

2.
First His six days' work was done, 
Then the Sabbath was begun; 
Thus He blessed the seventh day, 
Thus in resting we obey. 

Refrain:
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome; 
Glad we hail its presence blest, 
'Tis the great Jehovah's rest. 

3.
Thousands have His plan reversed, 
Resting now upon the first; 
Search the Book and you shall know 
There's no scripture tells them so. 

Refrain:
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome; 
Glad we hail its presence blest, 
'Tis the great Jehovah's rest. 

4.
All who speak the truth must say 
It was man who changed the day; 
In God's word no change appears 
Through the whole six thousand years! 
Thus I searched; and when I saw 
Only one great Sabbath law, 
Then I hastened to obey' 
Plainly, 'twas the only way.

Refrain:
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome; 
Glad we hail its presence blest, 
'Tis the great Jehovah's rest.
