## 633. O SOMETIMES THE SHADOWS ARE DEEP

```txt
1.
Sing the wondrous love of Jesus;
Sing his mercy and his grace.
In the mansions bright and blessed
He’ll prepare for us a place.


2.
While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
Clouds will overspread the sky;
But when traveling days are over,
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

3.
Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving every day;
Just one glimpse of him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

4.
Onward to the prize before us!
Soon his beauty we’ll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open;
We shall tread the streets of gold.
