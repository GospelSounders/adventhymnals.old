## 632. CLOSER TO THEE, MY FATHER, DRAW ME

```txt
1.
My heart can sing when I pause to remember,
A heartache here is but a stepping stone.
Along a trail, thats winding always upward,
This troubled world, is not my final home.


2.
The things of earth will dim and lose their value,
If we recall theyâ€™re borrowed for awhile;
And things of earth that cause the heart to tremble,
Remembered there, will only bring a smile.
```
