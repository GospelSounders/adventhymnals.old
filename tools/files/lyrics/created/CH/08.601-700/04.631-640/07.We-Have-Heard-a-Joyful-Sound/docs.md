## 637. WE HAVE HEARD A JOYFUL SOUND

```txt
1.
We have heard the joyful sound, 
Jesus saves, Jesus saves; 
Spread the tidings all around, 
Jesus saves, Jesus saves; 
Bear the news to every land, 
Climb the steeps and cross the waves, 
Onward! 'tis our Lord's command; 
Jesus saves, Jesus saves. 

2.
Waft it on the rolling tide, 
Jesus saves, Jesus saves; 
Tell to sinners far and wide, 
Jesus saves, Jesus saves; 
Sing, ye islands of the sea, 
Echo back, ye ocean caves; 
Earth shall keep her jubilee, 
Jesus saves, Jesus saves. 

3.
Sing above the battle's strife, 
Jesus saves, Jesus saves; 
By His death and endless life, 
Jesus saves, Jesus saves; 
Sing it softly thru the gloom, 
When the heart for mercy craves, 
Sing in triumph o'er the tomb, 
Jesus saves, Jesus saves. 

4.
Give the winds a mighty voice, 
Jesus saves, Jesus saves; 
Let the nations now rejoice. 
Jesus saves, Jesus saves; 
Shout salvation full and free, 
Highest hills and deepest caves, 
This our song of victory, 
Jesus saves, Jesus saves.
