## 638. I HAVE A SONG I LOVE TO SING

```txt
1.
I have a song I love to sing, 
Since I have been redeemed; 
Of my Redeemer, Saviour, King, 
Since I have been redeemed. 

Refrain:
Since I have been redeemed, 
Since I have been redeemed, 
I will glory in His name, 
Since I have been redeemed, 
I will glory in my Saviour's name 

2.
I have a Christ that satisfies, 
Since I have been redeemed; 
To do His will my highest prize, 
Since I have been redeemed. 

Refrain:
Since I have been redeemed, 
Since I have been redeemed, 
I will glory in His name, 
Since I have been redeemed, 
I will glory in my Saviour's name 

3.
I have a witness bright and clear, 
Since I have been redeemed; 
Dispelling every doubt and fear, 
Since I have been redeemed. 

Refrain:
Since I have been redeemed, 
Since I have been redeemed, 
I will glory in His name, 
Since I have been redeemed, 
I will glory in my Saviour's name 

4.
I have a home prepared for me, 
Since I have been redeemed; 
Where I shall dwell eternally, 
Since I have been redeemed.

Refrain:
Since I have been redeemed, 
Since I have been redeemed, 
I will glory in His name, 
Since I have been redeemed, 
I will glory in my Saviour's name
