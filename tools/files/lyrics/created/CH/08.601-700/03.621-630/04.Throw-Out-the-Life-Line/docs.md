## 624. THROW OUT THE LIFE LINE

```txt
1.
I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)
I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)
All along my pilgrim journey,
I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)

2.
In my trials, Lord walk with me.
(walk with me)
In my trials, Lord walk with me.
(walk with me)
When the shades of life are falling,
I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)

3.
In my sorrows, Lord walk with me.
(walk with me)
In my sorrows, Lord walk with me.
(walk with me)
When my heart within is aching,
I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)
