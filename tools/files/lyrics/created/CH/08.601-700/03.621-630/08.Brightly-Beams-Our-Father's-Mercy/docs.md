## 628. BRIGHTLY BEAMS OUR FATHER'S MERCY

```txt
1.
Brightly beams our Father's mercy, 
From His lighthouse evermore, 
But to us He gives the keeping 
Of the lights along the shore. 

Refrain:
Let the lower lights be burning! 
Send a gleam across the wave! 
Some poor fainting, struggling seaman 
You may rescue, you may save. 

2.
Dark the night of sin has settled, 
Loud the angry billows roar; 
Eager eyes are watching, longing, 
For the lights along the shore. 

Refrain:
Let the lower lights be burning! 
Send a gleam across the wave! 
Some poor fainting, struggling seaman 
You may rescue, you may save. 

3.
Trim You feeble lamp, my brother: 
Some poor sailor, tempest tossed, 
Trying now to make the harbor, 
In the darkness may be lost.

Refrain:
Let the lower lights be burning! 
Send a gleam across the wave! 
Some poor fainting, struggling seaman 
You may rescue, you may save.
