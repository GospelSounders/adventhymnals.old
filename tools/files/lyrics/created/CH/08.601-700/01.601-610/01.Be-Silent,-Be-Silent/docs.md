## 601. BE SILENT, BE SILENT

```txt
1.
Be silent, be silent,
A whisper is heard;
Be silent, and listen,
Oh treasure each word.
CHORUS:
Tread softly, tread softly, The Master is here;
Tread softly, tread softly, He bids us draw near.

2.
Be silent, be silent,
For holy this place,
This altar that echoes
The message of grace.

3.
Be silent, be silent,
Breathe humbly our prayer;
A foretaste of Eden
This moment we share.

4.
Be silent, be silent,
His mercy record;
Be silent, be silent,
And wait on the Lord.
```
