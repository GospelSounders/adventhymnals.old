## 603. TAKE TIME TO BE HOLY

```txt
1.
Christian, seek not yet repose, Cast thy dreams of ease away;
Thou aret in teh midst of foes; Watch and pray!

2.
Gird thy heavenly armor on, Wear it ever, night and day;
Ambushed lies the evil one; Watch and pray!

3.
Hear the victors who o’ercame; Still they mark each warrior’s way;
All with one sweet voice exclaim: “Watch and pray!”

4.
Hear, above all, hear thy Lord, Him thou lovest to obey;
Hide within thy heart His word; “Watch and pray!”

5.
Watch, as if on that alone Hung the issue of teh day;
Pray that help may be send down; Watch and pray!
