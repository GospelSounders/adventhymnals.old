## 674. IN HEAVENLY LOVE ABIDING

```txt
1.
In heavenly love abiding, 
No change my heart shall fear; 
And safe is such confiding, 
For nothing changes here. 
The storm may roar without me, 
My heart may low be laid, 
But God is round about me, 
And can I be dismayed? 
But God is round about me, 
And can I be dismayed? 

2.
Wherever He may guide me, 
No want shall turn me back; 
My Shepherd is besided me, 
And nothing can I lack. 
His wisdom ever waketh, 
His sight is never dim, 
He knows the way He taketh, 
And I will walk with Him. 
He knows the way He taketh, 
And I will walk with Him. 

3.
Green pastures are before me, 
Which yet I have not seen; 
Bright skies will soon be o'er me, 
Where darkest clouds have been. 
My hope I cannot measure, 
My path to life is free, 
My Savior has my teasure, 
And He will walk with me. 
My Savior has my teasure, 
And He will walk with me.
