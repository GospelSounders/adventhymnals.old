## 680. ANCIENT OF DAYS

```txt
1.
Holy Spirit, hear us;
Help us while we sing;
Breath into the music
Of the praise we bring.

2.
Holy Spirit, prompt us
When we kneel to pray;
Nearer come, and teach us
What we ought to say.

3.
Holy Spirit, shine Thou
On the Book we read;
Gild itâ€™s holy pages
With the light we need.
```
