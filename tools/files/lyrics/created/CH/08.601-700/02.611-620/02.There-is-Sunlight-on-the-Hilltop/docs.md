## 612. THERE IS SUNLIGHT ON THE HILLTOP

```txt
1.
There is sunlight on the hilltop, 
There is sunlight on the sea; 
And the golden beams are sleeping, 
On the soft and verdant lea; 
But a richer light is filling 
All the chambers of my heart; 
For Thou dwellest there, my Saviour, 
And 'tis sunlight where Thou art. 

Refrain:
O the sunlight! beautiful sunlight! 
O the sunlight in the heart! 
Jesus' smile can banish sadness; 
It is sunlight in the heart. 

2.
In the dust I leave my sadness, 
As the garb of other days; 
For Thou robest me with gladness, 
And Thou fillest me with praise; 
And to that bright home of glory 
Which Thy love hath won for me, 
In my heart and mind ascending, 
My glad spirit follows Thee. 

Refrain:
O the sunlight! beautiful sunlight! 
O the sunlight in the heart! 
Jesus' smile can banish sadness; 
It is sunlight in the heart. 

3.
Loving Saviour, Thou hast bought me, 
And my life, my all, is Thine; 
Let the lamp Thy love hath lighted 
To Thy praise and glory shine; 
And to that bright home of glory 
Which Thy love hath won for me, 
In my heart and mind ascending, 
My glad spirit follows Thee.

Refrain:
O the sunlight! beautiful sunlight! 
O the sunlight in the heart! 
Jesus' smile can banish sadness; 
It is sunlight in the heart.
