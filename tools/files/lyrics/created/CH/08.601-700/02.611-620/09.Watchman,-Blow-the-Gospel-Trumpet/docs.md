## 619. WATCHMAN, BLOW THE GOSPEL TRUMPET

```txt
1.
Watchman, blow the gospel trumpet,
Every soul a warning give;
Whosoever hears the message
May repent, and, turn and live.
CHORUS:
Blow the trumpet, trusty watchman,
Blow it loud o'er land and sea;
God commissions, sound the message!
Every captive may be free.

2.
Sound it loud o'er every hilltop,
Gloomy shade and sunny plain;
Ocean depths repeat the message,
Full salvation's glad refrain.

3.
Sound it in the hedge and highway,
Earth's dark spots where exiles roam;
Let it tell all things are ready,
Father waits to welcome home.

4.
Sound it for the heavy laden,
Weary, longing to be free;
Sound a Savior's invitation,
Sweetly saying, Come to me.
```
