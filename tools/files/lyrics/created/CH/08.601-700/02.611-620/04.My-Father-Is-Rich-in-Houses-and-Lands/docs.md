## 614. MY FATHER IS RICH IN HOUSES AND LANDS

```txt
1.
Sound the battle cry,
See! the foe is nigh;
Raise the standard high
For the Lord;
Gird your armor on,
Stand firm, every one,
Rest your cause upon His holy word.


2.
Strong to meet the foe,
Marching on we go,
While our cause we know
Must prevail;
Shield and banner bright,
Gleaming in the light,
Battling for the right,
We ne’er can fail.

3.
O Thou God of all,
Hear us when we call,
Help us, one and all,
By Thy grace;
When the battle’s done,
And the victory won,
May we wear the crown
Before Thy face.
```
