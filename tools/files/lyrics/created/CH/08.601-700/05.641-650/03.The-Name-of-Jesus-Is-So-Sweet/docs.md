## 643. THE NAME OF JESUS IS SO SWEET

```txt
1.
The name of Jesus is so sweet, 
I love its music to repeat; 
It makes my joys full and complete, 
The precious name of Jesus. 

Refrain:
"Jesus," oh, how sweet the name! 
"Jesus," every day the same; 
"Jesus," let all saints proclaim 
Its worthy praise forever. 

2.
I love the name of Him Whose heart 
Knows all my grief's and bears a part; 
Who bids all anxious fears depart' 
I love the name of Jesus. 

Refrain:
"Jesus," oh, how sweet the name! 
"Jesus," every day the same; 
"Jesus," let all saints proclaim 
Its worthy praise forever. 

3.
That name I fondly love to hear, 
It never fails my heart to cheer, 
Its music dries the falling tear; 
Exalt the name of Jesus. 

Refrain:
"Jesus," oh, how sweet the name! 
"Jesus," every day the same; 
"Jesus," let all saints proclaim 
Its worthy praise forever. 

4.
No word of man can ever tell 
How sweet the name I love so well; 
Oh, let its praises ever swell; 
Oh, praise the name of Jesus.

Refrain:
"Jesus," oh, how sweet the name! 
"Jesus," every day the same; 
"Jesus," let all saints proclaim 
Its worthy praise forever.
