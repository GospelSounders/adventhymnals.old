## 650. IN JOYFUL HIGHS AND HOLY LAYS

```txt
1.
In joyful high and holy lays 
My soul her grateful voice would raise; 
But who can sing the worthy praise 
Of the wonderful love of Jesus? 

Refrain:
Wonderful love! wonderful love! 
Wonderful love of Jesus! 
Wonderful love! wonderful love! 
Wonderful love of Jesus! 

2.
A joy by day, a peace by night, 
In storms a calm, in darkness light, 
In pain a balm, in weakness might, 
Is the wonderful love of Jesus. 

Refrain:
Wonderful love! wonderful love! 
Wonderful love of Jesus! 
Wonderful love! wonderful love! 
Wonderful love of Jesus! 

3.
My hope for pardon when I call, 
My trust for lifting when I fall, 
In life, in death, my all in all, 
Is the wonderful love of Jesus.

Refrain:
Wonderful love! wonderful love! 
Wonderful love of Jesus! 
Wonderful love! wonderful love! 
Wonderful love of Jesus!
