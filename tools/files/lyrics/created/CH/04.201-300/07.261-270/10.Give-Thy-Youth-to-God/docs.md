## 270. GIVE THY YOUTH TO GOD

```txt
1.
Give thou thy youth to God, 
With all its budding love; 
Send up the opening heart to him, 
Fix it on things above. 

2.
He seeks thy heart, my child; 
He wants to make thee blest; 
Thy soul with his own joy to fill, 
To give thee peace and rest. 

3.
Take thou the side of God, 
In all things great or small; 
So shall he ever take thy side, 
And bear thee safe through all. 
Guide me in the path to heaven.

```
