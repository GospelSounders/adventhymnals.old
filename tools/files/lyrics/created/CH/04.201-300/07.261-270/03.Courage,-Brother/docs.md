## 263. COURAGE, BROTHER

```txt
1.
Fire of God, Thou sacred flame,
Spirit who in splendor came,
Let Thy heat my soul refine
Till it glows with love divine.

2.
Breath of God, that swept in power
In the pentecostal hour,
Holy Breath, be Thou in me
Source of vital energy.

3.
Strength of God, Thy might within
Conquers sorrow, pain, and sin:
Fortify from evil’s art
All the gateways of my heart.

4.
Truth of God, Thy piercing rays
Penetrate my secret ways.
May the light that shames my sin
Guide me holier paths to win.

5.
Love of God, Thy grace profound
Knoweth neither age nor bound:
Come, my heart’s own guest to be,
Dwell forevermore in me.
