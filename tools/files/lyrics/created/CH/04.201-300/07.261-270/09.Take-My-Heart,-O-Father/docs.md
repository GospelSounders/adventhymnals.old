## 269. TAKE MY HEART, O FATHER

```txt
1.
Take my heart, O Father, take it! 
Make and keep it all thine own; 
Let thy Spirit melt and break it, 
This proud heart of sin and stone. 

2.
Father, make it pure and lowly, 
Fond of peace and far from strife; 
Turning from the paths unholy, 
Of this vain and sinful life. 

3.
Ever let thy grace surround me, 
Strengthen me with power divine; 
By thy cords of love that bound me, 
Make me to be wholly thine. 

4.
May the blood of Jesus heal me, 
And my sins be all forgiven; 
Holy Spirit, take and seal me, 
Guide me in the path to heaven.
