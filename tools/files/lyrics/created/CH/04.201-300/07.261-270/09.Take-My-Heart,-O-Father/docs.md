## 269. TAKE MY HEART, O FATHER

```txt
1.
Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
With all Thy quickening powers;
Kindle a flame of sacred love
In these cold hearts of ours.

2.
O raise our thoughts from things below,
From vanities and toys!
Then shall we with fresh courage go
To reach eternal joys.

3.
Awake our souls to joyful songs;
Let pure devotions rise;
Till praise employs our thankful tongues,
And doubt forever dies.

4.
Father, we would no longer live
At this poor, dying rate;
To Thee our thankful love we give,
For Thine to us is great.

5.
Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,
With all Thy quickening powers;
Come, shed abroad a Saviorâ€™s love,
And that shall kindle ours.
```
