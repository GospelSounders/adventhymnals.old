## 242. 'TIS BY THE FAITH OF JOYS

```txt
1.
'Tis by the faith of joys to come 
We walk through deserts dark as night; 
Till we arrive at Heaven our home, 
Truth is our guide, and faith our light. 

2.
The want of sight she well supplies, 
She makes the pearly gates appear; 
Far into distant worlds she pries, 
And brings eternal glories near. 

3.
Though lions roar, and tempests blow, 
And rocks and dangers fill the way, 
With joy we tread the desert through, 
While faith inspires a heavenly ray.
