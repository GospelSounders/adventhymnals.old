## 246. MY FAITH LOOKS UP TO THEE

```txt
1.
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb,
That was slain.


2.
Savior, let Thy kingdom come!
Now the power of sin consume;
Bring Thy blest millennium,
Holy Lamb.

3.
Thus may we
each moment feel,
Love Him, serve Him,
praise Him still,
Till we all on Zion’s hill
See the Lamb.
```
