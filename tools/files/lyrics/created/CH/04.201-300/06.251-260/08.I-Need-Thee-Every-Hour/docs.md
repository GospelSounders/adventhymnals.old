## 258. I NEED THEE EVERY HOUR

```txt
1.
Baptize us anew With power from on high,
With love, O refresh us! Dear Savior, draw nigh.


2.
Unworthy we cry, Unholy, unclean,
O wash us and cleanse us From sin’s guilty stain.

3.
O heavenly Dove, Descend from on high!
We plead Thy rich blessing; In mercy draw nigh.

4.
O list the glad voice! From heaven it came:
Thou art My beloved, Well pleased I am.
