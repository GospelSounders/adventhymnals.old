## 219. HOLY BIBLE, BOOK DIVINE

```txt
1.
Holy Bible! Book divine! 
Precious treasure, thou art mine! 
Mine to tell me whence I came; 
Mine to teach me what I am. 

2.
Mine to chide me when I rove; 
Mine to show a Savior's love; 
Mine to guide my wayward feet; 
Mine to judge, condemn, acquit. 

3.
Mine to comfort in distress; 
If the Holy Spirit bless; 
Mine to show by living faith, 
Man can triumph over death. 

4.
Mine to tell of joys to come, 
In the saint's eternal home: 
O thou holy Book divine, 
Precious treasure, thou art mine! 
I win the strife.
