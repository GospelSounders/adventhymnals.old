## 220. I LOVE THE SACRED BOOK

```txt
1.
I love the sacred book of God, 
No other can its place supply; 
It points me to the saints' abode, 
And bids me from destruction fly. 

2.
Sweet book! in thee my eyes discern 
The image of my absent Lord; 
From thy instructive page I learn 
The joys His presence will afford. 

3.
But while I'm here, thou shalt supply 
His place, and tell me of His love; 
I'll read with faith's discerning eye, 
And thus partake of joys above. 

4.
Within thy sacred lids is found 
A transcript of my Maker's will; 
Treasures of knowledge here abound, 
The deepest, loftiest mind to fill. 

5.
Light of the world, thy beams impart, 
To lead my feet through life's dark way; 
O, shine on this benighted heart, 
Nor let me from thy guidance stray.
