## 220. I LOVE THE SACRED BOOK

```txt
1.
When He comes,
When He comes,
We shall see the Lord in glory when He comes!
As I read the gospel story,
We shall see the Lord in glory,
We shall see the Lord in glory when He comes!


2.
When He comes,
When He comes,
We shall hear the trumpet sounded when He comes!
We shall hear the trumpet sounded,
See the Lord by saints surrounded,
We shall hear the trumpet sounded when He comes!

3.
When He comes,
When He comes,
We shall all rise up to meet Him when He comes!
We shall all rise up to meet Him,
When He calls His own to greet Him
We shall all rise up to meet Him when He comes!
