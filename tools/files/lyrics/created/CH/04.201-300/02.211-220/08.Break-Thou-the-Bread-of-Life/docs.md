## 218. BREAK THOU THE BREAD OF LIFE

```txt
1.
Break thou the bread of life, 
Dear Lord, to me, 
As thou didst break the loaves 
Beside the sea; 
Beyond the sacred page 
I seek thee, Lord; 
My spirit pants for thee, 
O living Word! 

2.
Bless thou the truth revealed 
This day to me, 
As thou didst bless the bread 
By Galilee; 
Then shall all bondage cease, 
All fetters fall; 
And I shall find in thee, 
My all in all! 

3.
Spirit and life are they, 
Words thou dost speak; 
I hasten to obey, 
But I am weak; 
Thou art my only help, 
Thou art my life; 
Heeding thy holy word 
I win the strife.
