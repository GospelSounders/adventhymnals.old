## 218. BREAK THOU THE BREAD OF LIFE

```txt
1.
When He cometh, when He cometh
To make up His jewels,
All His jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own.


2.
He will gather, He will gather
The gems for His kingdom;
All the pure ones, all the bright ones,
His loved and His own.

3.
Little children, little children,
Who love their Redeemer,
Are the jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own.
