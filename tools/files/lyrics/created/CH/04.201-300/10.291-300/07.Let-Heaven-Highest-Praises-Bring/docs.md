## 297. LET HEAVEN HIGHEST PRAISES BRING

```txt
1.
God, be merciful to me,
On Thy grace I rest my plea;
Plenteous in compassion Thou,
Blot out my transgressions now;
Wash me, make me pure within,
Cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin,
Wash me, make me pure within,
Cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin.

2.
I am evil, born in sin;
Thou desirest truth within.
Thou alone my Savior art,
Teach Thy wisdom to my heart;
Make me pure, Thy grace bestow,
Wash me whiter than the snow,
Make me pure, Thy grace bestow,
Wash me whiter than the snow.

3.
Gracious God, my heart renew,
Make my spirit right and true;
Cast me not away from Thee,
Let Thy Spirit dwell in me;
Thy salvation’s joy impart,
Steadfast make my willing heart,
Thy salvation’s joy impart,
Steadfast make my willing heart.

4.
Sinners then shall learn from me
And return, O God, to Thee;
Savior, all my guilt remove,
And my tongue shall sing Thy love;
Touch my silent lips, O Lord,
And my mouth shall praise accord,
Touch my silent lips, O Lord,
And my mouth shall praise accord.
