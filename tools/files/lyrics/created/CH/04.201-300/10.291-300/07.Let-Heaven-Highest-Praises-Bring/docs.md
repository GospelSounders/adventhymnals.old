## 297. LET HEAVEN HIGHEST PRAISES BRING

```txt
1.
Let heaven highest praises bring, 
And earth her songs of gladness sing, 
To magnify our Saviour, King, 
Who bought us by His precious blood. 

2.
May all the suffering Thou hast borne, 
The bleeding side, the cruel thorn, 
Our hearts to Thee in sorrow turn, 
And lead us safely home to God. 

3.
By scourgings, spittings, stripes, and scars, 
Jesus, the Maker of the stars, 
The gates of heaven for us unbars, 
And bids us freely enter in. 

4.
Fill us, O Saviour, with Thy love, 
Grant us eternal joys above, 
Oh, faithful to Thy promise prove, 
And cleanse us from our every sin.
