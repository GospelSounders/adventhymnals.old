## 298. HARK, MY SOUL! IT IS THE LORD

```txt
1.
Hark, my soul! it is the Lord; 
'Tis thy Saviour, hear His word; 
Jesus speaks, and speaks to thee, 
"Say, poor sinner, lovest thou Me?" 

2.
"Mine is an unchanging love, 
Higher than the heights above; 
Deeper than the depths beneath, 
Free and faithful, strong as death." 

3.
"Thou shalt see My glory soon, 
When the work of grace is done; 
Partner of My throne shalt be! 
Say, poor sinner, lovest thou Me?" 

4.
Lord, it is my chief complaint 
That my love is weak and faint; 
Yet I love Thee and adore; 
O for grace to love more!
