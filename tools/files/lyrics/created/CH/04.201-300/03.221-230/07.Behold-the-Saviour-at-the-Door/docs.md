## 227. BEHOLD THE SAVIOUR AT THE DOOR

```txt
1.
Behold the Saviour at the door! 
He gently knocks, has knocked before, 
Has waited long, is waiting still; 
You treat no other friend so ill. 

2.
He counsels thee to buy of him 
Gold tried by fire, and raiment clean; 
Anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see, 
And put away thy stains from thee. 

3.
O, hear the faithful Witness' voice, 
He offers now a final choice; 
Thou art offensive, O lukewarm! 
Therefore be zealous and reform. 

4.
His mission now is almost o'er, 
Before the throne He'll plead no more; 
The filthy must his filth retain, 
He that is holy, so remain. 

5.
His locks with dews of night are wet, 
But at thy heart he lingereth yet. 
O wake, and open wide the door; 
Bid thy Beloved wait no more. 

6.
Yea, bring him in, a welcome guest; 
So shalt thou in his presence rest, 
And in communion sweet and free, 
Shalt sup with him and he with thee.
