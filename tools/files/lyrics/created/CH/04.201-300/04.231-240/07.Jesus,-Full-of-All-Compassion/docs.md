## 237. JESUS, FULL OF ALL COMPASSION

```txt
1.
Jesus, full of all compassion, 
Hear thy humble suppliant's cry; 
Let me know thy great salvation; 
See, I languish, faint and die. 
Guilty, but with heart relenting, 
Overwhelmed with helpless grief, 
Prostrate at Thy feet repining, 
Send, O send me quick relief. 

2.
Whither should my soul be flying, 
But to him who comfort gives? 
Whither, from the dread of dying, 
But to him who ever lives? 
While I view thee, wounded, grieving, 
Breathless, on the cursed tree, 
Fain I'd feel my heart believing 
Thou didst suffer thus for me. 

3.
With thy righteousness and Spirit, 
I am more than angels blessed; 
Heir with thee, all things inherit' 
Peace, and joy, and endless rest. 
Saved! the deed shall spread new glory 
Through the shining realms above; 
Angels sing the pleasing story, 
All enraptured with thy love.

```
