## 281. THERE LIVES A VOICE WITHIN ME

```txt
1.
There lives a voice within me, 
Guest angel of my heart, 
Whose whisperings strive to win me 
To act a noble part. 
Up evermore it springeth 
Like some sweet melody, 
And evermore it singeth 
This song of songs to me: 

Refrain:
This world is full of beauty 
That points the soul above, 
And if we did our duty, 
It might be full of love. 

2.
The leaf tongues of the forest, 
The flower lips of the sod, 
The birds that hymn their raptures 
Up to the throne of God; 
The summer wind that bringeth 
Joy over land and sea, 
Have each a voice that singeth 
This song of songs to me: 

Refrain:
This world is full of beauty 
That points the soul above, 
And if we did our duty, 
It might be full of love. 

3.
O voice of God most tender, 
O voice of God divine, 
Still be my heart's defender 
Till every thought is Thine; 
My soul in gladness bringeth 
Its songs of praise to Thee, 
While all around me singeth 
This song of songs to me:

Refrain:
This world is full of beauty 
That points the soul above, 
And if we did our duty, 
It might be full of love.
