## 287. SAVIOUR, BLESSED SAVIOUR

```txt
1.
Saviour, blessed Saviour, Listen whilst we sing, 
Hearts and voices raising Praises to our King. 
All we have we offer; All we hope to be, 
Body, soul, and spirit, All we yield to Thee. 

2.
Nearer, ever nearer, Christ, we draw to Thee, 
Deep in adoration Bending low the knee. 
Thou for our redemption Camest on earth to die; 
Thou, that we might follow, Hast gone up on high. 

3.
Great, and ever greater, Are Thy mercies here, 
True and ever lasting Are the glories there, 
Where no pain, or sorrow, Toil, or care is known, 
Where the angel legions Circle round Thy throne. 

4.
Clearer still and clearer Dawns the light from heaven, 
In our sadness bringing News of sin forgiven; 
Life has lost its shadows, Pure the light within; 
Thou hast shed Thy radiance on a world of sin. 

5.
Onward, ever onward, Journeying o'er the road 
Worn by saints before us Journeying on to God; 
Leaving all behind us, may we hasten on, 
Backward never looking till the prize is won.
