## 285. I GIVE MY HEART TO THEE

```txt
1.
I give my heart to Thee, 
O Jesus most desired; 
And heart for heart the gift shall be, 
For Thou my soul hast fired. 

2.
Thou hearts alone wouldst move, 
Thou only hearts dost love; 
I would love Thee as Thou lovest me, 
O Jesus most desired. 

3.
What offering can I make, 
Dear Lord, to love like Thine' 
That Thou, the Word, didst stoop to take 
A human form like mine? 

4.
Thy heart is opened wide, 
Its offered love most free, 
That heart to heart I may abide, 
And hide myself in Thee. 

5.
Ah, how Thy love doth burn, 
Till I that love return! 
I would love Thee as Thou lovest me, 
O Jesus most desired.
