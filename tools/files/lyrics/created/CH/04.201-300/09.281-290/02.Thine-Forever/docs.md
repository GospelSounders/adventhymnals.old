## 282. THINE FOREVER

```txt
1.
I hear Thy welcome voice,
That calls me, Lord, to Thee;
For cleansing in Thy precious blood,
That flowed on Calvary.


2.
Though coming weak and vile,
Thou dost my strength assure;
Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,
Till spotless all, and pure.

3.
‘Tis Jesus calls me on
To perfect faith and love,
To perfect hope, and peace, and trust,
For earth and heaven above.

4.
All hail, atoning blood!
All hail, redeeming grace!
All hail! the gift of Christ, our Lord,
Our Strength and Righteousness.
