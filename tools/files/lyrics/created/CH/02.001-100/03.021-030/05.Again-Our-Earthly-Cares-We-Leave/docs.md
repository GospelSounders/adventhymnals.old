## 25. AGAIN OUR EARTHLY CARES WE LEAVE

```txt
1.
Praise the Lord, His glories show, Alleluia!
Saints within His courts below, Alleluia!
Angels â€™round His throne above, Alleluia!
All that see and share His love, Alleluia!

2.
Earth to heaven and heaven to earth, Alleluia!
Tell His wonders, sing His worth, Alleluia!
Age to age and shore to shore, Alleluia!
Praise Him, praise Him evermore! Alleluia!

3.
Praise the Lord, His mercies trace, Alleluia!
Praise His providence and grace, Alleluia!
All that He for man hath done, Alleluia!
All He sends us through His Son. Alleluia!
