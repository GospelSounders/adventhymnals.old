## 92. THERE IS A BOOK

```txt
1.
There is a book that all may read, 
Which heavenly truth imparts; 
And all the lore its scholars need, 
Pure eyes and Christian hearts. 

2.
The works of God above, below, 
Within us, and around, 
Are pages in that book, to show 
How God Himself is found. 

3.
The glorious sky, embracing all, 
Is like the Maker's love, 
Wherewith encompassed, great and small 
In peace and order move. 

4.
The dew of Heaven is like Thy grace, 
It steals in silence down; 
But where it falls, the favored place 
By richest fruits is known. 

5.
Thou, who hast given me eyes to see, 
And love for what is fair, 
Give me a heart to find out Thee, 
And read Thee everywhere.
