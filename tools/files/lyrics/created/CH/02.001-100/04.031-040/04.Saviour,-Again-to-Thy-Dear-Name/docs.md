## 34. SAVIOUR, AGAIN TO THY DEAR NAME

```txt
1.
Saviour, again to Thy dear name we raise 
With one accord our parting hymn of praise. 
We stand to bless Thee ere our worship cease, 
Then, lowly kneeling, wait Thy word of peace. 

2.
Grant us Thy peace upon our homeward way; 
With Thee began, with Thee shall end, the day. 
Guard Thou the lips from sin, the heart from shame, 
That in this house have called upon Thy name. 

3.
Grant us Thy peace throughout our earthly life, 
Our balm in sorrow, and our stay in strife. 
Then when Thy voice shall bid our conflict cease, 
Call us, O Lord, to Thine eternal peace!
