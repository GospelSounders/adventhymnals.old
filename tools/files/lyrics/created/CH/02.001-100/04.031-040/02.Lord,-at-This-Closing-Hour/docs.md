## 32. LORD, AT THIS CLOSING HOUR

```txt
1.
Lord, at this closing hour 
Establish every heart 
Upon Thy word of truth and power, 
To keep us when we part. 

2.
Peace to our brethren give; 
Fill all our hearts with love; 
In faith and patience may we live, 
And seek our rest above. 

3.
Through changes, bright or drear, 
We would Thy will pursue, 
And toil to spread Thy kingdom here 
Till we its glory view.

```
