## 54. THE SHADOWS OF THE EVENING HOURS

```txt
1.
The shadows of the evening hours 
Fall from the darkening sky, 
Upon the fragrance of the flowers 
The dews of evening lie. 
Before Thy throne, O Lord of heaven, 
We kneel at close of day; 
Look on Thy children from on high, 
And hear us while we pray. 

2.
The sorrows of Thy servants, Lord, 
O do not Thou despise, 
But let the incense of our prayers 
Before Thy mercy rise; 
The brightness of the coming night 
Upon the darkness rolls; 
With hopes of future glory chase 
The shadows on our souls. 

3.
Let peace, O Lord! Thy peace, O God, 
Upon our souls descend; 
From midnight fears, and perils, Thou 
Our trembling hearts defend: 

8.Give us a respite from our toil, 
Calm and subdue our woes; 
Through the long day we labor, Lord, 
O give us now repose.
