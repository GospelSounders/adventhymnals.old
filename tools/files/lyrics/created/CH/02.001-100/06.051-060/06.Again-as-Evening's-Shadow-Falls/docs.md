## 56. AGAIN AS EVENING'S SHADOW FALLS

```txt
1.
Again, as evening's shadow falls, 
We gather in these hallowed walls; 
And vesper hymn and vesper prayer 
Rise mingling on the holy air. 

2.
May struggling hearts that seek release 
Here find the rest of God's own peace; 
And, strengthened here by hymn and prayer, 
Lay down the burden and the care. 

3.
O God, our Light! to Thee we bow; 
Within all shadows standest Thou; 
Give deeper calm than night can bring; 
Give sweeter songs than lips can sing. 
Amen.
