## 11. THE LORD JEHOVAH REIGNS

```txt
1.
The God of Abraham praise,
Who reigns enthroned above;
Ancient of everlasting days,
And God of love;
Jehovah! Great I AM!
By earth and heaven confessed;
I bow and bless the sacred name,
Forever blest.

2.
The God of Abraham praise,
At whose supreme command
From earth I rise, and seek the joys
At His right hand;
I all on earth forsake,
Its wisdom, fame and power;
And Him my only portion make,
My shield and tower.

3.
The whole triumphant host
Give thanks to God on high;
“Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!”
They ever cry;
Hail, Abraham’s God and mine!
I join the heavenly lays;
All might and majesty are Thine,
And endless praise.
