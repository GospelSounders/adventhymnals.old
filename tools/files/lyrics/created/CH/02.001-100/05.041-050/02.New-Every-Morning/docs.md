## 42. NEW EVERY MORNING

```txt
1.
Now that the daylight fills the sky,
We lift our hearts to God on high,
That He, in all we do or say,
Would keep us free from harm today;

2.
Would guard our hearts and tongues from strife;
From anger’s din would shield our life;
From evil sights would turn our eyes,
And close our ears to vanities;

3.
So we, when this new day is gone
And night in turn is drawing on,
With conscience by the world unstained
Shall praise His name for vict’ry gained.

4.
“All praise to You, creator Lord!
All praise to You, eternal Word!
All praise to You, O Spirit wise!”
We sing as daylight fills the skies.
