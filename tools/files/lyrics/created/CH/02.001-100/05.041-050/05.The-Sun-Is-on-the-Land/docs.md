## 45. THE SUN IS ON THE LAND

```txt
1.
The sun is on the land and sea, 
The day begun; 
Our morning hymn begins with Thee, 
Blest Three in One: 
Our praise shall rise continually 
Till day is done. 

2.
Thy love was ever in our view, 
Like stars, by night; 
Thy gifts are ev'ry morning new, 
O God of light; 
Thy mercy, like the heavens' blue, 
Fills all our sight. 

3.
We do not know what grief or care 
The day may bring: 
The heart shall find some gladness there 
That loves its King; 
The life that serves Thee ev'rywhere 
Can always sing. 

4.
All glory to the Father be, 
With Christ the Son, 
And, Holy Spirit, unto Thee, 
Forever One; 
All glory to the Trinity 
While ages run.
