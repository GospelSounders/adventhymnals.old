## 77. YE WATCHERS AND YE HOLY ONES

```txt
1.
Ye watchers and ye holy ones,
Bright seraphs, cherubim and thrones,
Raise the glad strain, Alleluia!
Cry out, dominions, princedoms, powers,
Virtues, archangels, angels' choirs:

Refrain:
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia!

2.
O higher than the cherubim,
More glorious than the seraphim,
Lead their praises, Alleluia!
Thou bearer of th'eternal Word,
Most gracious, magnify the Lord.

Refrain:
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia!

3.
O friends, in gladness let us sing,
Supernal anthems echoing,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
To God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit, Three in One.

Refrain:
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia!
