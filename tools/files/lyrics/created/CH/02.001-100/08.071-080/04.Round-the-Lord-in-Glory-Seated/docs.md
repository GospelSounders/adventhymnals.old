## 74. ROUND THE LORD IN GLORY SEATED

```txt
1.
Round the Lord in glory seated, 
Cherubim and seraphim 
Filled His temple, and repeated 
Each to each th'alternate hymn: 
'Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven, 
Earth is with Thy fullness stored; 
Unto Thee be glory given, 
Holy, holy, holy Lord.' 

2.
Heaven is still with glory ringing, 
Earth takes up the angels' cry, 
'Holy, holy, holy,' singing, 
'Lord of Hosts, the Lord most high.' 
With His seraph train before Him, 
With His holy church below, 
Thus unite we to adore him, 
Bid we thus our anthem flow. 

3.
'Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven, 
Earth is with Thy fullness stored; 
Unto Thee be glory given, 
Holy, holy, holy Lord.' 
Thus Thy glorious name confessing, 
With Thine angels hosts we cry, 
'Holy, holy, holy,' blessing 
Thee, the Lord of hosts Most High.
