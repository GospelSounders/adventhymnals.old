## 72. EARLY, MY GOD, WITHOUT DELAY

```txt
1.
Creator of the stars of night,
Thy peopleâ€™s everlasting light,
O Christ, Thou Saviour of us all,
We pray Thee, hear us when we call.

2.
At the great name of Jesus, now
All knees must bend, all hearts must bow;
And things celestial Thee shall own,
And things terrestrial, Lord alone.

3.
To God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit, Three in One,
Laud, honour, might, and glory be
From age to age eternally.
Amen.
```
