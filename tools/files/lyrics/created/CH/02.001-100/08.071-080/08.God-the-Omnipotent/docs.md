## 78. GOD THE OMNIPOTENT

```txt
1.
For God so loved us,
He sent the Savior:
For God so loved us,
and loves me too.


2.
He sent the Savior,
the blest Redeemer;
He sent the Savior
to set me free.

3.
He bade me welcome,
O word of mercy;
He bade me welcome,
O voice divine.

4.
Glory and honor,
O Love eternal,
To Him be given
while life shall last.
```
