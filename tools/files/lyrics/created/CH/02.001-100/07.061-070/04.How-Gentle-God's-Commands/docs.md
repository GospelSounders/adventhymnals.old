## 64. HOW GENTLE GOD'S COMMANDS

```txt
1.
How gentle God's commands! 
How kind His precepts are! 
Come, cast your burdens on the Lord, 
And trust His constant care. 

2.
Beneath His watchful eye 
His saints securely dwell; 
That hand which bears all nature up 
Shall guard His children well. 

3.
Why should this anxious load 
Press down your weary mind? 
Haste to your Heavenly Father's throne, 
And sweet refreshment find. 

4.
His goodness stands approved 
Through each succeeding day; 
I'll drop my burden at His feet, 
And bear a song away.
