## 69. HIGH IN THE HEAVENS

```txt
1.
Lord, make us more holy;
Lord, make us more holy;
Lord, make us more holy
Until we meet again.

2.
Lord, make us more faithful;
Lord, make us more faithful;
Lord, make us more faithful
Until we meet again.

3.
Lord, make us more humble;
Lord, make us more humble;
Lord, make us more humble
Until we meet again.

4.
Lord, make us more loving;
Lord, make us more loving;
Lord, make us more loving
Until we meet again.
Like Jesus, the Saviour,
Until we meet again.
