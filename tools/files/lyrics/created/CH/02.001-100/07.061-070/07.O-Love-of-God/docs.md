## 67. O LOVE OF GOD

```txt
1.
O Lord, now let Your servant
Depart in heavâ€™nly peace,
For I have seen the glory
Of Your redeeming grace:
A light to lead the Gentiles
Unto Your holy hill,
The glory of Your people,
Your chosen Israel.

2.
Then grant that I may follow Your gleam,
O glorious Light,
Till earthly shadows scatter,
And faith is changed to sight;
Till raptured saints shall gather
Upon that shining shore,
Where Christ, the blessed Day star,
Shall light them evermore.
```
