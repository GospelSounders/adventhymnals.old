## 200. I LONG TO BEHOLD HIM

```txt
1.
I long to behold Him arrayed 
With glory and light from above; 
The King in His beauty displayed, 
His beauty of holiest love: 
I languish, and sigh to be there, 
Where Jesus hath fixed His abode; 
O, when shall we meet in the air, 
And fly to the mountain of God? 

2.
With Him, I on Zion shall stand, 
For Jesus has spoken the word; 
The breath of Immanuel's land, 
Survey, by the side of my Lord! 
But when, on Thy bosom reclined, 
Thy face I am strengthened to see, 
My fullness of rapture I find, 
My heaven of heavens, in Thee. 

3.
How happy the people whose home 
Is found in the city of God! 
As pilgrims no more they shall roam, 
Nor travel a dangerous road. 
Physician divine, unto me 
Thy soul-healing blessing now give, 
And keep me while waiting for Thee, 
And then to that city receive.
