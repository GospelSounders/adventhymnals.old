## 192. HARK! THAT SHOUT

```txt
1.
Hark! that shout of rapture high, 
Bursting forth from yonder cloud; 
Jesus comes, and, through the sky, 
Angels tell their joy aloud, 
Angels tell their joy aloud. 

2.
Hark! the trumpet's awful voice 
Sounds abroad o'er sea and land; 
Let His people now rejoice; 
Their redemption is at hand, 
Their redemption is at hand. 

3.
See, the Lord appears in view; 
Heaven and earth before Him fly; 
Rise, ye saints, He comes for you; 
Rise, to meet Him in the sky, 
Rise, to meet Him in the sky. 

4.
Go and dwell with Him above, 
Where no foe can e'er molest; 
Happy in the Saviour's love, 
Ever blessing, ever blest, 
Ever blessing, ever blest.
