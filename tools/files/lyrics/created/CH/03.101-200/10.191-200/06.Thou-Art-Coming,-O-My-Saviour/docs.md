## 196. THOU ART COMING, O MY SAVIOUR

```txt
1.
Thou art coming, O my Saviour, 
Thou art coming, O my King, 
In Thy beauty all resplendent, 
In Thy glory all transcendent; 
Well may we rejoice and sing: 
Coming! in the opening east 
Herald brightness slowly swells; 
Coming! O my glorious Priest, 
Hear we not Thy golden bells? 

2.
Thou art coming, Thou art coming; 
We shall meet Thee on Thy way, 
We shall see Thee, we shall know Thee, 
We shall bless Thee, We shall show Thee 
All our hearts could never say; 
What an anthem that will be, 
Ringing out our love to Thee, 
Pouring out our rapture sweet 
At Thine own allglorious feet. 

3.
Thou art coming; we are waiting 
With a hope that cannot fail, 
Asking not the day or hour, 
Resting on Thy word of power, 
Anchored safe within the veil. 
Time appointed may be long, 
But the vision must be sure; 
Certainly must make us strong, 
Joyful patience can endure. 

4.
O the joy to see Thee reigning, 
Thee, our own belov'd Lord! 
Every tongue Thy name, confessing, 
Worship, honor, glory, blessing 
Brought to Thee with one accord; 
Thee, our Master and our Friend, 
Vindicated and enthroned, 
Unto earth's remotest end 
Glorified, adored, and owned.
