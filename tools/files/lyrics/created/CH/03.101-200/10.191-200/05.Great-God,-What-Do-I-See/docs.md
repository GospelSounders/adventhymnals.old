## 195. GREAT GOD, WHAT DO I SEE

```txt
1.
“There shall be showers of blessing;”
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Savior above.


2.
“There shall be showers of blessing;”
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain.

3.
“There shall be showers of blessing;”
Send them upon us, O Lord;
Grant to us now a refreshing;
Come, and now honor Thy word.

4.
“There shall be showers of blessing;”
O that today they might fall,
Now as to God were confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call!
