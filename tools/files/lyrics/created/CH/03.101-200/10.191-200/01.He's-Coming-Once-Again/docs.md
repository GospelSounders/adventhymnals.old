## 191. HE'S COMING ONCE AGAIN

```txt
1.
He's coming once again, 
To set His people free; 
That where He is, in glory bright, 
His saints may also be. 
Then lift the drooping head, 
Look up, rejoice and sing; 
He comes, in majesty sublime, 
Salvation's glorious King! 

2.
The earth shall quake with fear, 
The heavens shall flee away; 
And where shall guilty man appear 
In that tremendous day? 
No refuge then is nigh, 
No shelter from the blast; 
The night of vengeance veils the sky 
When mercy's day is past. 

3.
His eyes of living flame 
The wicked shall devour; 
No tongue will lightly speak the name 
Of Jesus in that hour. 
No scorn, no words of hate 
For His meek followers then; 
But prayers and tears that come too late 
Will mark earth's mighty men.
