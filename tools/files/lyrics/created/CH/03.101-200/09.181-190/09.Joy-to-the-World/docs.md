## 189. JOY TO THE WORLD

```txt
1.
Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,
By His presence all divine?
True and tender, pure and precious,
Oh, how blest to call Him mine!


2.
Love of Christ so freely given,
Grace of God beyond degree,
Mercy higher than the heaven,
Deeper than the deepest sea.

3.
Every need His hand supplying,
Every good in Him I see;
On His strength divine relying,
He is All in All to me.

4.
By the crystal flowing river
With the ransomed I will sing,
And forever and forever
Praise and glorify the King.
```
