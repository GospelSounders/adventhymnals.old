## 190. WHEN THOU, MY RIGHTEOUS JUDGE

```txt
1.
Jesus loves me! this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak but He is strong


2.
Jesus loves me! He wo died
Heavenâ€™s gate to open wide:
He will wash away my sin,
Let His little child come in.

3.
Jesus, take this heart of mine,
Make it pure and wholly thine;
On the coross You died for me,
I will love and live for Thee.
