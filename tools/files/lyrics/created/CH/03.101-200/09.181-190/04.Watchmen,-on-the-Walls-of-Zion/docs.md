## 184. WATCHMEN, ON THE WALLS OF ZION

```txt
1.
I hear the Savior say,
“Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all.”


2.
Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone,
Can change the leper’s spots
And melt the heart of stone.

3.
Since nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim,
I’ll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.

4.
And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete,
I’ll lay my trophies down
All down at Jesus’ feet.
```
