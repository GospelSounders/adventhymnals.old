## 186. LONG FOR MY SAVIOUR I'VE BEEN WAITING

```txt
1.
Long for my Saviour I've been waiting, 
Long time have watched by night and day; 
Feared, lest my faith and hope abating, 
I should lose courage by the way. 

Refrain:
Jesus soon is coming; 
This is my song' 
Cheers the heart when joys depart, 
And foes are pressing strong. 

2.
Here in this vale of sin and sorrow 
I have been wandering many years, 
Still looking for that happy morrow 
When God would wipe away my tears. 

Refrain:
Jesus soon is coming; 
This is my song' 
Cheers the heart when joys depart, 
And foes are pressing strong. 

3.
Oftimes the tempter comes in power, 
Fain then would lead my steps astray; 
But when the clouds begin to lower, 
Hope turns the darkness into day. 

Refrain:
Jesus soon is coming; 
This is my song' 
Cheers the heart when joys depart, 
And foes are pressing strong. 

4.
O it will be but little longer 
I must these many woes endure; 
Then let my faith and hope grow stronger; 
My Father's promise still is sure.

Refrain:
Jesus soon is coming; 
This is my song' 
Cheers the heart when joys depart, 
And foes are pressing strong.
