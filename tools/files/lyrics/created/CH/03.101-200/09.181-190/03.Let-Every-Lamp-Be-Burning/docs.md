## 183. LET EVERY LAMP BE BURNING

```txt
1.
I Will sing of Jesus love,
Sing of Him,who first loved me;
for He left bright worlds above,
And died on Calvary.


2.
O the depths of love divine!
Earth or heaven can never know
How that sin as dark as mine
can be made as white as snow.

3.
Nothing good for Him I’ve done;
How could He such love bestow?
Lord, I own my heart is won,
help me now my love to show.
```
