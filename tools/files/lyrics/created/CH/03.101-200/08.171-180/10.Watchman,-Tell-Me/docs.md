## 180. WATCHMAN, TELL ME

```txt
1.
O listen to our wondrous story,
Counted once among the lost;
Yet One came down from heaven’s glory,
Saving us at awful cost!


2.
No angel could His place have taken,
Highest of the high tho’ he;
The loved One on the cross forsaken
Was One of the Godhead three!

3.
Will you surrender to this Savior?
To His scepter humbly bow?
You, too, shall come to know His favor,
He will save you, save you now.
```
