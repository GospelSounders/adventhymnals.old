## 171. THERE IS A NAME I LOVE

```txt
1.
There is a name I love to hear, 
I love to sing its worth; 
It sounds like music in mine ear, 
The sweetest name on earth. 

2.
It tells me of a Saviour's love, 
Who died to set me free; 
It tells me of His precious blood, 
The sinner's perfect plea. 

3.
It tells me of a Father's smile 
Beaming upon His child; 
It cheers me through this little while, 
Through desert, waste, and wild. 

4.
Jesus, the name I love so well, 
The name I love to hear; 
No saint on earth its worth can tell, 
No heart conceive how dear. 

5.
This Name shall shed its fragrance still 
Along this thorny road, 
Shall sweetly smooth the rugged hill 
That leads me up to God.
