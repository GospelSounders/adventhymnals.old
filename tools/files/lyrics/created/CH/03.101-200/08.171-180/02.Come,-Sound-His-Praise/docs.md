## 172. COME, SOUND HIS PRAISE

```txt
1.
Come, sound His praise abroad, 
And hymns of glory sing; 
Jehovah is the sovereign God, 
The universal King. 

2.
He formed the deeps unknown; 
He gave the seas their bound; 
The watery worlds are all His own, 
And His the solid ground. 

3.
Come, worship at His throne, 
Come, bow before the Lord; 
We are His works, and not our own; 
He formed us by His word. 

4.
Today attend His voice, 
Nor dare provoke His rod; 
Come, like the people of His choice, 
And own your gracious God.
