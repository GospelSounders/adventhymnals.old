## 164. O SAVIOUR, PRECIOUS SAVIOUR

```txt
1.
O Saviour, precious Saviour, 
Whom, yet unseen, we love, 
O Name of might and favor, 
All other names above! 
We worship Thee, we bless Thee, 
To Thee, O Christ we sing; 
We praise Thee, and confess Thee 
Our holy Lord and King. 

2.
O bringer of salvation, 
Who wondrously hast wrought, 
Thyself the revelation 
Of love beyond out thought, 
We worship Thee, we bless Thee, 
To Thee, O Christ we sing; 
We praise Thee, and confess Thee 
Our gracious Lord and King. 

3.
In Thee all fulness dwelleth, 
All grace and power divine; 
The glory that excelleth, 
O Son of God, is Thine; 
We worship Thee, we bless Thee, 
To Thee, O Christ we sing; 
We praise Thee, and confess Thee 
Our glorious Lord and King. 

4.
O grant the consummation 
Of this our song above, 
In endless adoration, 
And everlasting love; 
Then shall we praise and bless Thee 
Where perfect praises ring, 
And evermore confess Thee 
Our Saviour and our King.
