## 169. THOU HIDDEN SOURCE

```txt
1.
Thou hidden source of calm repose, 
Thou all-sufficient love divine; 
My help and refuge from my foes, 
Secure I am if thou art mine, 
From sin and grief, from guilt and shame; 
I hide me, Jesus, in Thy name. 

2.
Thy mighty name salvation is, 
And keeps my happy soul above; 
Comfort it brings, and power and peace, 
And joy and everlasting love; 
To me with Thy dear name, are given 
Pardon and holiness and heaven. 

3.
Jesus, my all in all Thou art, 
My rest in toil, my ease in pain; 
The medicine of my broken heart; 
In war, my peace; in loss, my gain; 
My smile beneath the tyrant's frown; 
In shame, my glory and my crown. 

4.
In want, my plentiful supply; 
In weakness, my almighty power; 
In bonds, my perfect liberty; 
My light in Satan's darkest hour; 
In grief, my joy unspeakable; 
My life in death; my heaven, my all.
