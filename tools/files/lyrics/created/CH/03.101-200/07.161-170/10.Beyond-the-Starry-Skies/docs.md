## 170. BEYOND THE STARRY SKIES

```txt
1.
Beyond the starry skies, 
Far as th'eternal hills, 
There, in the soundless world of light 
Our great Redeemer dwells. 
Around Him angels fair, 
In countless armies shine; 
And ever, in exalted lays, 
They offer songs divine. 

2.
"Hail, Prince of life!" they cry, 
"Whose unexampled love 
Moved Thee to quit those glorious realms 
And royalties above." 
And when He stooped to earth, 
And suffered rude disdain, 
They cast their honors at His feet, 
And waited in His train. 

3.
They saw Him on the cross, 
While darkness veiled the skies; 
And when He burst the gates of death, 
They saw the Conqueror rise. 
They thronged His chariot wheels, 
And bore Him to His throne; 
Then swept their golden harps and sang, 
"That glorious work is done."
