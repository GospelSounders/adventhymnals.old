## 138. WITHIN THE VEIL

```txt
1.
There’s a star in the east on Christmas morn.
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.
It will lead to the place and where the Saviour’s born,
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.


2.
If you take good heed to the angel’s words,
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.
You’ll forget your flocks,
you’ll forget your herds,
Rise up, shepherd, and follow.
```
