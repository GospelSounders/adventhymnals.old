## 133. ON WINGS OF LIVING LIGHT

```txt
1.
On wings of living light 
At earliest dawn of day, 
Came down the angel bright 
And rolled the stone away. 

Refrain:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; 
Rejoice; again I say, Rejoice. 
Your voices raise with one accord 
To bless and praise your risen Lord. 

2.
The keepers watching near, 
At that dread sight and sound 
Fell down with sudden fear, 
Like dead men to the ground. 

Refrain:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; 
Rejoice; again I say, Rejoice. 
Your voices raise with one accord 
To bless and praise your risen Lord. 

3.
Then rose from death's dark gloom, 
With angels standing by, 
Triumphant o'er the tomb, 
The Lord of earth and sky. 

Refrain:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; 
Rejoice; again I say, Rejoice. 
Your voices raise with one accord 
To bless and praise your risen Lord. 

4.
Ye children of the light, 
Arise with Him, arise; 
See, how the Day-star bright 
Is burning in the skies!

Refrain:
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice; 
Rejoice; again I say, Rejoice. 
Your voices raise with one accord 
To bless and praise your risen Lord.
