## 114. THE HIDDEN YEARS AT NAZARETH

```txt
1.
The hidden years at Nazareth ! 
How Beautiful they seem, 
Like fountains flowing in the dark 
Or waters in a dream ! 
Like waters under Syrian stars 
Reflecting lights above, 
Repeating in their silent depths 
The wonder of God's love. 

2.
The hidden years at Nazareth ! 
How marvelous they lie, 
As open to the smile of God 
As to the Syrians sky ! 
As open to the heart of man 
As to the genial sun, 
With dreams of high asventuring, 
And deeds of kindness done. 

3.
The hidden years at Nazareth ! 
How radiant they rise 
With life and death in balance laid 
Before a lad's clear eyes ! 
O soul of youth, forever choose, 
Forgetting fate or fear, 
To live for truth, or die with God, 
Who stands beside thee here.
