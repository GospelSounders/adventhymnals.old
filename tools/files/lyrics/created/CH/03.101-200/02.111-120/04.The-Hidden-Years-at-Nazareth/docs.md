## 114. THE HIDDEN YEARS AT NAZARETH

```txt
1.
There’s a wideness, in God’s mercy,
like the wideness of the sea;
There is mercy, with the Savior,
Which is more than liberty.

2.
There is welcome, for the sinner,
and more graces for the good;
There is mercy, with the Savior,
There is healing in His blood.

3.
For the love of God is broader
Than the measure of man’s mind.
And the heart of the Eternal,
is most wonderfully kind.

4.
If our love were but more simple,
We should take Him at His word;
And our lives would be all sunshine,
In the sweetness of our Lord.
