## 120. WHEN I SURVEY THE WONDROUS CROSS

```txt
1.
When I survey the wondrous cross 
On which the Prince of glory died, 
My richest gain I count but loss, 
And pour contempt on all my pride. 

2.
See, from His head, His feet, 
Sorrow and love flow mingled down; 
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet? 
Or thorns compose so rich a crown? 

3.
Since I, who was undone and lost, 
Have pardon through His name and word; 
Forbid it, then, that I should boast, 
Save in the cross of Christ my Lord. 

4.
Were the whole realm of nature mine, 
That were a tribute far too small; 
Love so amazing, so divine, 
Demands my life, my soul, my all.
