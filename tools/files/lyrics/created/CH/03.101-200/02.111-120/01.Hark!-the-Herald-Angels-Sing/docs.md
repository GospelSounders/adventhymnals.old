## 111. HARK! THE HERALD ANGELS SING

```txt
1.
My Father is omnipotent
And that you can’t deny;
A God of might and miracles;
‘Tis written in the sky.


2.
Though here His glory has been shown,
We still can’t fully see
The wonders of His might, His throne;
‘Till eternity.

3.
The Bible tells us of His power
And wisdom all way through;
And every little bird and flower
Are testimonies, too.
```
