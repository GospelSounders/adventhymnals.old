## 106. THERE'S A SONG IN THE AIR

```txt
1.
There's a song in the air! 
There's a star in the sky! 
There's a mother's deep prayer 
And a baby's low cry! 
And the star rains its fire 
While the beautiful sing, 
For the manger of Bethlehem 
Cradles a King! 

2.
There's a tumult of joy 
O'er the wonderful birth, 
For the virgin's sweet boy 
Is the Lord of the earth. 
Aye! the star rains its fire 
While the beautiful sing, 
For the manger of Bethlehem 
Cradles a King! 

3.
In the light of that star 
Lie the ages impearled; 
And that song from afar 
Has swept over the world. 
Every hearth is aflame, 
And the beautiful sing 
In the homes of the nations 
That Jesus is King! 

4.
We rejoice in the light, 
And we echo the song 
That comes down through the night 
From the heavenly throng. 
Aye! we shout to the lovely 
Evangel they bring, 
And we greet in his cradle 
Our Savior and King!
