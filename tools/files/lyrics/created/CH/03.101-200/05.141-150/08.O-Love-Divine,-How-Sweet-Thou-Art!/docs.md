## 148. O LOVE DIVINE, HOW SWEET THOU ART!

```txt
1.
O love divine, how sweet thou art! 
When shall I find my willing heart 
All taken up by thee? 
I thirst, I faint, I die to prove 
The greatness of redeeming love, 
The love of Christ to me. 

2.
Stronger His love than death or hell; 
Its riches are unsearchable; 
The first born sons of light 
Desire in vain its depths to see; 
They cannot reach the mystery, 
The length, and breadth, and height. 

3.
God only knows the love of God; 
O that it now were shed abroad 
In this poor stony heart! 
For love I sigh, for love I pine; 
This only portion, Lord, be mine' 
Be mine this better part! 

4.
O that I could forever sit 
With Mary at the Master's feet! 
Be this my happy choice; 
My only care, delight, and bliss, 
My joy, my heaven on earth, be this 
To hear the Bridegroom's voice.
