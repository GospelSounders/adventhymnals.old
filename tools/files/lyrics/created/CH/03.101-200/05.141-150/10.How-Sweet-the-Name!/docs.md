## 150. HOW SWEET THE NAME!

```txt
1.
Who is He in yonder stall,
At whose feet the shepherds fall?


2.
Who is He in deep distress,
Fasting in the wilderness?

3.
Who is He, the gathering throng
Greet with loud triumphant song?

4.
Lo, at midnight, who is He
Prays in dark Gethsemane?

5.
Who is He on yonder tree
Dies in shame and agony?

6.
Who is He that from the grave
Comes to heal and help and save?

7.
Who is He that from His throne
Rules through all the world alone?
