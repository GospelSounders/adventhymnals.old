## 141. WE MAY NOT CLIMB

```txt
1.
What child is this, who, laid to rest,
On Mary`s lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping?


2.
Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian, fear: for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.

3.
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come, peasant, king, to own Him,
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
```
