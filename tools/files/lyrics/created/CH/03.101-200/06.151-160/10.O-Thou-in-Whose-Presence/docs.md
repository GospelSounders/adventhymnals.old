## 160. O THOU IN WHOSE PRESENCE

```txt
1.
Ride on! ride on in majesty!
Hark, all the tribes hosanna cry;
O Savior meek, pursue Thy road
With palms and scattered garments strowed.

2.
Ride on! ride on in majesty!
In lowly pomp ride on to die;
O Christ, Thy triumphs now begin
Oâ€™er captive death and conquered sin.

3.
Ride on! ride on in majesty!
The winged squadrons of the sky
Look down with sad and wondering eyes
To see the approaching sacrifice.

4.
Ride on! ride on in majesty!
In lowly pomp ride on to die;
Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain,
Then take, O God, Thy power and reign.
