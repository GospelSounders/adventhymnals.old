## 154. JESUS, THOU JOY OF LOVING HEARTS

```txt
1.
When I survey the wondrous cross
on which the Prince of Glory died;
my richest gain I count but loss,
and pour contempt on all my pride.

2.
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
save in the death of Christ, my God;
all the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to his blood.

3.
See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
sorrow and love flow mingled down.
Did eâ€™er such love and sorrow meet,
or thorns compose so rich a crown.

4.
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
that were an offering far too small;
love so amazing, so divine,
demands my soul, my life, my all.
