## 159. MAJESTIC SWEETNESS SITS ENTHRONED

```txt
1.
Majestic sweetness sits enthroned 
Upon the Saviour's brow; 
His head with radiant light is crowned, 
His lips with grace o'erflow, 
His lips with grace o'erflow. 

2.
No mortal can with Him compare, 
Among the sons of men; 
Fairer is He than all the fair 
That fill the heav'nly train, 
That fill the heav'nly train. 

3.
He saw me plunged in deep distress, 
And flew to my relief; 
For me He bore the shameful cross, 
And carried all my grief, 
And carried all my grief. 

4.
To Him I owe my life and breath, 
And all the joys I have; 
He makes me triumph over death, 
He saves me from the grave, 
He saves me from the grave. 

5.
To Heaven, the place of His abode, 
He brings my weary feet; 
Shows me the glories of my God, 
And makes my joys complete, 
And makes my joys complete. 

6.
Since from His bounty I receive 
Such proofs of love divine, 
Had I a thousand hearts to give, 
Lord, they should all be Thine, 
Lord, they should all be Thine.
