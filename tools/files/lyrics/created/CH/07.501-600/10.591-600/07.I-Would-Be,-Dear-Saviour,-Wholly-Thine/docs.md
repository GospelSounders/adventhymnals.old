## 597. I WOULD BE, DEAR SAVIOUR, WHOLLY THINE

```txt
1.
I would be, dear Savior, wholly Thine;
Teach me how, teach me how;
I would do Thy will, O Lord, not mine;
Help me, help me now.
CHORUS:
Wholly Thine, wholly Thine,
Wholly Thine, this is my vow;
Wholly Thine, wholly Thine,
Wholly Thine, O Lord, just now.

2.
What is worldly pleasure, wealth or fame,
Without Thee, without Thee?
I will leave them all for Thy dear Name,
This my wealth shall be.

3.
As I cast earth.s transient joys behind,
Come Thou near, come Thou near;
In Thy presence all in all I find,
.Tis my comfort here
