## 558. IN THE LAND OF FADELESS DAY

```txt
1.
In the land of fadeless day 
Lies 'the city foursquare;' 
It shall never pass away, 
And there is 'no night there.' 

Refrain:
God shall 'wipe away all tears;' 
There's no death, no pain, nor fears; 
And they count not time by years, 
For there is 'no night there.' 

2.
All the gates of pearl are made, 
In 'the city foursquare;' 
All the streets with gold are laid, 
And there is 'no night there.' 

Refrain:
God shall 'wipe away all tears;' 
There's no death, no pain, nor fears; 
And they count not time by years, 
For there is 'no night there.' 

3.
All the gates shall never close, 
To 'the city foursquare;' 
There life's crystal river flows, 
And there is 'no night there.' 

Refrain:
God shall 'wipe away all tears;' 
There's no death, no pain, nor fears; 
And they count not time by years, 
For there is 'no night there.' 

4.
There they need no sunshine bright, 
In 'that city foursquare;' 
For the Lamb is all the light, 
And there is 'no night there.'

Refrain:
God shall 'wipe away all tears;' 
There's no death, no pain, nor fears; 
And they count not time by years, 
For there is 'no night there.'
