## 523. TAKE THE NAME OF JESUS WITH YOU

```txt
1.
My faith has found a resting place,
Not in a manmade creed;
I trust the ever living One,
That He for me shall plead.


2.
Enough for me that Jesus saves,
This ends my fear and doubt;
A sinful soul, I come to Him,
He will not cast me out.

3.
My soul is resting on the Word,
The living Word of God,
Salvation in my Savior’s name,
Salvation through His blood.

4.
My great Physician heals the sick,
The lost He came to save;
For me His precious blood He shed,
For me His life He gave.
