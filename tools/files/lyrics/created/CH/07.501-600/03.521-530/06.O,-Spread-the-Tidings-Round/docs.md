## 526. O, SPREAD THE TIDINGS ROUND

```txt
1.

0. spread the tidings round, 
Wherever man is found, 
Wherever human hearts 
And human woes abound; 
Let every Christian tongue 
Proclaim the joyful sound: 
The Comforter has come! 

2.
The long, long night is past, 
The morning breaks at last; 
And hushed the dreadful wail 
And fury of the blast, 
As o'er the golden hills 
The day advances fast. 
The Comforter has come! 

3.
O boundless Love divine! 
How shall this tongue of mine 
To wondering mortals tell 
The matchless grace divine' 
That I, a child of sin, 
Should in His image shine! 
The Comforter has come! 

4.
Sing, 'till the echoes fly 
Above the vaulted sky, 
And all the saints above 
To all below reply, 
In strains of endless love, 
The song that ne'er will die: 
The Comforter has come!
