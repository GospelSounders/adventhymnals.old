## 572. JESUS, THE LOVING SHEPHERD

```txt
1.
Jesus, the loving Shepherd, 
Calleth thee now to come 
Into the fold of safety, 
Where there is rest and room; 
Come in the strength of manhood, 
Come in the morn of youth, 
Enter the fold of safety, 
Enter the way of truth. 

Refrain:
Lovingly, tenderly calling is He: 
Wanderer, wanderer, come unto me; 
Patiently standing there, waiting. I see 
Jesus my Shepherd divine. 

2.
Jesus, the loving Shepherd, 
Gave His dear life for thee; 
Tenderly now He's calling, 
Wanderer, come to Me; 
Haste, for without is danger, 
Come, cries the Shepherd blest, 
Enter the fold of safety, 
Enter the place of rest. 

Refrain:
Lovingly, tenderly calling is He: 
Wanderer, wanderer, come unto me; 
Patiently standing there, waiting. I see 
Jesus my Shepherd divine. 

3.
Lingering is but folly; 
Wolves are abroad today, 
Seeking the sheep now straying, 
Seeking the lambs to slay; 
Jesus, the loving Shepherd, 
Calleth thee now to come 
Into the fold of safety, 
Where there is rest and room.

Refrain:
Lovingly, tenderly calling is He: 
Wanderer, wanderer, come unto me; 
Patiently standing there, waiting. I see 
Jesus my Shepherd divine.
