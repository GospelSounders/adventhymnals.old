## 539. IN THE GLAD TIME OF THE HARVEST

```txt
1.
I will early seek the Savior,
I will learn of Him each day;
I will follow in His footsteps,
I will walk the narrow way.


2.
I will hasten where He bids me,
I am not too young to go
In the pathway where He leadeth,
Not too young His will to know.

3.
He is standing at the doorway
Of escape from every sin;
I will knock, for He has promised,
He will hear and let me in.
```
