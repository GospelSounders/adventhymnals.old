## 566. THERE'S A STRANGER AT THE DOOR

```txt
1.
Father, we thank You for the light that shines all the day;
For the bright sky You have given most like Your heaven;
Father, we thank You.

2.
Father, we thank You for the lamps that lighten the way;
For human skill’s exploration of Your creation;
Father, we thank You.

3.
Father, we thank You for the friends who brighten our play;
For Your command to call others sisters and brothers;
Father, we thank You.

4.
Father, we thank You for Your love in Jesus today,
Giving us hope for tomorrow through joy and sorrow;
Father, we thank You.
