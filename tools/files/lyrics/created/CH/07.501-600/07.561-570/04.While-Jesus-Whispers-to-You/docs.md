## 564. WHILE JESUS WHISPERS TO YOU

```txt
1.
While Jesus whispers to you, 
Come, sinner, come! 
While we are praying for you, 
Come, sinner, come! 
Now is the time to own Him, 
Come, sinner, come! 
Now is the time to know Him, 
Come, sinner, come! 

2.
Are you too heavy laden? 
Come, sinner, come! 
Jesus will bear your burden, 
Come, sinner, come! 
Jesus will not deceive you, 
Come, sinner, come! 
Jesus can now redeem you, 
Come, sinner, come! 

3.
O hear His tender pleading, 
Come, sinner, come! 
Come and receive the blessing, 
Come, sinner, come! 
While Jesus whispers to you, 
Come, sinner, come! 
While we are praying for you, 
Come, sinner, come!
