## 543. TELL IT TO EVERY KINDRED AND NATION

```txt
1.
Jesus, Friend of little children,
Be a friend to me;
Take my hand and ever keep me
Close to Thee.

2.
Teach me how to grow in goodness,
Daily as I grow;
Thou hast been a child, and surely
Thou dost know.

3.
Step by step, O, lead me onward,
Upward into youth;
Wiser, stronger, still becoming
In Thy truth.

4.
Never leave me, nor forsake me;
Ever be my friend;
For I need Thee from life’s dawning
To its end.
```
