## 543. TELL IT TO EVERY KINDRED AND NATION

```txt
1.
Tell it to every kindred and nation, 
Tell it far and near; 
Earth's darkest night will fade with the dawning, 
Jesus will soon appear. 

Refrain:
Hail Him the King of glory, 
Once the Lamb for sinners slain; 
Tell, tell the wondrous story, 
'Jesus comes to reign.' 

2.
Nations again in strife and commotion, 
Warnings by the way; 
Signs in the heavens, unerring omens, 
Herald the glorious day. 

Refrain:
Hail Him the King of glory, 
Once the Lamb for sinners slain; 
Tell, tell the wondrous story, 
'Jesus comes to reign.' 

3.
Children of God look up with rejoicing; 
Shout and sing His praise; 
Blessed are they who, waiting and watching, 
Look for the dawning rays.

Refrain:
Hail Him the King of glory, 
Once the Lamb for sinners slain; 
Tell, tell the wondrous story, 
'Jesus comes to reign.'
