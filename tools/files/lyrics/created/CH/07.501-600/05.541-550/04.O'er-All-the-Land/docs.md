## 544. O'ER ALL THE LAND

```txt
1.
Jesus, Son of blessed Mary,
Once on earth a little child,
Pattern fair of holy living,
Gracious, loving, undefiled;

2.
Though Thy eager heart was yearning
Heavy laden souls to free,
Yet Thou calledst little children
In their happiness to Thee.

3.
Grant that we, like little children,
Free from pride and guile my be;
Cheerful, trusting, safe, protected
By the blessed Trinity.
```
