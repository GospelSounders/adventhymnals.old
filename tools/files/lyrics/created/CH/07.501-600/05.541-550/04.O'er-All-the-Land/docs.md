## 544. O'ER ALL THE LAND

```txt
1.
O'er all the land have the signs now appeared, 
Telling us soon our dear Saviour will come; 
Long has the worn pilgrim watched, hoped, and feared, 
Waiting for that blessed hope; 0 come, Saviour, come. 

Refrain:
Sound forth the tidings, long, loud, and clear; 
Jesus is coming, and soon will appear; 
All hearts respond as we long for our home, 
"Quickly come, 0 blessed Jesus, come, Saviour, come!" 

2.
Signs in the sun and the moon and the stars 
Faithfully show that the great day is near; 
Nations distressed by the rumors of wars, 
And the hearts of wicked men are failing for fear. 

Refrain:
Sound forth the tidings, long, loud, and clear; 
Jesus is coming, and soon will appear; 
All hearts respond as we long for our home, 
"Quickly come, 0 blessed Jesus, come, Saviour, come!" 

3.
These, to the pilgrim, are omens of cheer, 
Toiling and sighing in life's gloomy way; 
All, all proclaim that the Saviour is near, 
And the light is dawning of that soon-coming day. 

Refrain:
Sound forth the tidings, long, loud, and clear; 
Jesus is coming, and soon will appear; 
All hearts respond as we long for our home, 
"Quickly come, 0 blessed Jesus, come, Saviour, come!" 

4.
Then let us rally, and fresh courage take; 
Soon will we hear our dear Lord's loving voice; 
Those who will now all their errors forsake 
Soon the pearly gates will enter'sing and rejoice.

Refrain:
Sound forth the tidings, long, loud, and clear; 
Jesus is coming, and soon will appear; 
All hearts respond as we long for our home, 
"Quickly come, 0 blessed Jesus, come, Saviour, come!"
