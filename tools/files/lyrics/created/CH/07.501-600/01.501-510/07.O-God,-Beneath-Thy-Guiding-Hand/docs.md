## 507. O GOD, BENEATH THY GUIDING HAND

```txt
1.
Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine,
Living with Jesus, a new life divine,
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.


2.
Never a trial that He is not there,
Never a burden that He doth not bear,
Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
Moment by moment Iâ€™m under His care.

3.
Never a heart-ache, and never a groan,
Never a teardrop and never a moan;
Never a danger but there on teh throne,
Moment by moment He thinks of His own.

4.
Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
Jesus, my Savior, abides with me still.
