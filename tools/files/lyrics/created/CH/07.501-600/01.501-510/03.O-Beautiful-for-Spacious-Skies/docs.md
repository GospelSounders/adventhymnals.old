## 503. O BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES

```txt
1.
There is a quiet place,
Far from the rapid pace where God can soothe my troubled mind.
Sheltered by tree and flowâ€™r,
There in my quiet hour with Him my cares are left behind.
Whether a garden small,
Or on a mountain tall,
New strength and courage there I find;
Then from this quiet place
I go prepared to face a new day
With love for all mankind.
