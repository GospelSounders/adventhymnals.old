## 503. O BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES

```txt
1.
Skies O beautiful for spacious skies, 
For amber waves of grain, 
For purple mountain majesties 
Above the fruited plain! 
America! America! 
God shed His grace on thee, 
And crown thy good with brotherhood 
From sea to shining sea. 

2.
O beautiful for pilgrim feet, 
Whose stern, impassioned stress 
A thoroughfare for freedom beat 
Across the wilderness! 
America! America! 
God mend thine every flaw, 
Confirm thy soul in self-control, 
Thy liberty in law. 

3.
O beautiful for heroes proved 
In liberating strife, 
Who more than self their country loved, 
And mercy more than life! 
America! America! 
May God thy gold refine, 
Till all success be nobleness, 
And every gain divine. 

4.
O beautiful for patriot dream 
That sees, beyond the years, 
Thine alabaster cities gleam, 
Undimmed by human tears! 
America! America! 
God shed His grace on thee, 
And crown thy good with brotherhood 
From sea to shining sea.
