## 520. LIFT HIM UP

```txt
1.
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
A wonderful Savior to me,
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
Where rivers of pleasure I see.


2.
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away,
He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength as my day.

3.
With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,
And filled with His fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture, Oh, Glory to God
For such a Redeemer as mine.

4.
When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
Iâ€™ll shout with the millions on high.
