## 511. GENTLE PEACE, FROM HEAVEN DESCENDED

```txt
1.
I know not why Godâ€™s wondrous grace To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love Redeemed me for His own.


2.
I know not how this saving faith To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His word Wrought peace within my heart.

3.
I know not how the Spirit moves, Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus through the word, Creating faith in Him.

4.
I know not when my Lord may come, At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I walk the vale with Him, Or meet Him in the air.
