## 516. SWEET THE TIME

```txt
1.
Sweet the time, exceeding sweet! 
When the saints together meet, 
When the Saviour is the theme, 
When they join to sing of Him. 

2.
Sing we then eternal love, 
Such as did the Father move; 
He beheld the world undone, 
Loved the world and gave His Son. 

3.
Sing the Son's amazing love; 
How He left the realms above, 
Took our nature and our place, 
Lived and died to save our race. 

4.
Sing we, too, the Spirit's love; 
With our stubborn hearts He strove, 
Filled our minds with grief and fear, 
Brought the precious Saviour near. 

5.
Sweet the time, exceeding sweet, 
When the saints in heaven shall meet; 
Jesus still will be the theme, 
They shall always sing of Him.
