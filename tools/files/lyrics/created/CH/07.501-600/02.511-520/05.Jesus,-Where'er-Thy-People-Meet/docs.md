## 515. JESUS, WHERE'ER THY PEOPLE MEET

```txt
1.
The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?
By day and by night His presence is near;
He is my salvation from sorrow and sin;
This blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in.


2.
The Lord is my light; though clods may arise,
Faith, stronger than sight, looks up to the skies
Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign:
Then how can I ever in darkness remain?

3.
The Lord is my light, the Lord is my strength;
I know in His might Iâ€™ll conquer at length;
My weakness in mercy He covers with power,
And, walking by faith, He upholds me each hour.

4.
The lord is my light, my all and in all;
There is in His sight no darkness at all;
He is my Redeemer, my Savior and King;
With saints and with angels His praises I sing.
