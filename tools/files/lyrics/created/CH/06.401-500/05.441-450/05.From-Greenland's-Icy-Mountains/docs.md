## 445. FROM GREENLAND'S ICY MOUNTAINS

```txt
1.
From Greenland's icy mountains, 
From India's coral strand, 
Where Afric's sunny fountains 
Roll down their golden sands, 
From many an ancient river, 
From many a palmy plain, 
They call us to deliver 
Their land from error's chain. 

2.
What though the spicy breezes 
Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle; 
Though every prospect pleases, 
And only man is vile; 
In vain with lavish kindness 
The gifts of God are strewn; 
The heathen in his blindness, 
Bows down to wood and stone. 

3.
Can men, whose souls are lighted 
With wisdom from on high, 
Can they to men benighted 
The lamp of life deny? 
Salvation! O salvation! 
The joyful sound proclaim, 
Till earth's remotest nation 
Has learned Messiah's name. 

4.
Waft, waft, ye winds, His story, 
And you, ye waters, roll, 
Till, like a sea of glory, 
It spreads from pole to pole; 
Till o'er our ransomed nature 
The Lamb for sinners slain, 
Redeemer, King, Creator, 
In bliss returns to reign.
