## 443. WORKMAN OF GOD

```txt
1.
There’ll be no night in heaven,
In that blest world above;
No anxious toil, no weary hours;
For labor there is love.


2.
There’ll be no grief in heaven;
For life is one glad day,
And tears are those of former things
Which all have passed away.

3.
There’ll be no sin in heaven;
Behold that blessed throng,
All holy in there spotless robes,
All holy in their song.
```
