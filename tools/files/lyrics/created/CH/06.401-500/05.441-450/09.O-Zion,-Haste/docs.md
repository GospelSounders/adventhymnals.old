## 449. O ZION, HASTE

```txt
1.
There is a land of pure delight,
Where bliss eternal reigns,
Infinite day excludes the night
And pleasures banish pain.


2.
There everlasting spring abides,
And never with’ring flowers,
And but a little space divides
This heav’nly land from ours.

3.
Could we but stand where Moses stood,
And view the landscape o’er,
Not all this world’s pretended good
Could ever charm us more.
```
