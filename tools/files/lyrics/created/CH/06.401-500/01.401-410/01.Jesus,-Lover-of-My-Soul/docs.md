## 401. JESUS, LOVER OF MY SOUL

```txt
1.
In imitation, Lord, of Thee,
This solemn service we repeat;
For Thine example full of grace,
Has made this humble duty sweet.

2.
Renew each sacred spark of love,
And vitalize the holy flame;
May union strong our hearts unite
While this we do in Jesusâ€™ name.

3.
Our great example Thou shalt be,
In washing Thy disciples feet;
And as we follow Thy command,
Make Thou our fellowship complete.
```
