## 406. LEAD THOU ME ON

```txt
1.
Love consecrates the humblest act
And haloes mercyâ€™s deeds;
It sheds a benediction sweet
And hallows human needs.

2.
When in the shadow of the cross
Christ knelt and washed the feet
Of His disciples, He gave us
A sign of love complete.

3.
Love serves and willing, stoops to serve;
What Christ in love so true
Has freely done for one and all,
Let us now gladly do!
```
