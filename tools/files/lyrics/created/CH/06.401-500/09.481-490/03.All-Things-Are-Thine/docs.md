## 483. ALL THINGS ARE THINE

```txt
1.
I need thee every hour, most gracious Lord;
no tender voice like thine can peace afford.


2.
I need thee every hour; stay thou nearby;
temptations lose their power when thou art nigh.

3.
I need thee every hour, in joy or pain;
come quickly and abide, or life is vain.

4.
I need thee every hour; teach me thy will;
and thy rich promises in me fulfill.
```
