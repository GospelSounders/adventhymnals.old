## 485. GREAT KING OF GLORY

```txt
1.
Great King of glory, come, 
And with Thy favor crown 
This temple as Thy home, 
This people as Thine own; 
Beneath this roof, 0 deign to show 
How God can dwell with men below. 

2.
Here may Thine ears attend 
Our interceding cries, 
And grateful praise ascend, 
Like incense, to the skies; 
Here may Thy word melodious sound, 
And spread celestial joys around. 

3.
Here may our unborn sons 
And daughters sound Thy praise, 
And shine, like polished stones, 
Through long-succeeding days; 
Here, Lord, display Thy saving power, 
While temples stand and men adore. 

4.
Here may the listening throng 
Receive Thy truth in love; 
Here Christians join the song 
Of seraphim above, 
Till all, who humbly seek Thy face, 
Rejoice in Thy abounding grace.
