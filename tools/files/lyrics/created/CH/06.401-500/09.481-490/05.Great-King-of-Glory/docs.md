## 485. GREAT KING OF GLORY

```txt
1.
I must tell Jesus all of my trials,
I cannot bear these burdens alone;
In my distress He kindly will help me,
He ever loves and cares for His own.


2.
I must tell Jesus all of my troubles,
He is a kind, compassionate Friend;
If I but ask Him He will deliver,
Make of my troubles quickly an end.

3.
Oh, how the world to evil allures me!
Oh, how my heart is tempted to sin!
I must tell Jesus, and He will help me
Over the world the victâ€™ry to win.
```
