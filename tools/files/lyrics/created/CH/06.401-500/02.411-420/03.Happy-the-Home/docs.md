## 413. HAPPY THE HOME

```txt
1.
Happy the home when God is there, 
And love fills every breast; 
When one their wish, and one their prayer, 
And one their heavenly rest. 

2.
Happy the home where Jesus' name 
Is sweet to every ear; 
Where children early speak his fame, 
And parents hold him dear. 

3.
Happy the home where prayer is heard, 
And praise is wont to rise; 
Where parents love the sacred Word 
And all its wisdom prize. 

4.
Lord, let us in our homes agree 
This blessed peace to gain; 
Unite our hearts in love to thee, 
And love to all will reign.
