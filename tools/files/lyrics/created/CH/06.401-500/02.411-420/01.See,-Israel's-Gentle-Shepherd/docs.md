## 411. SEE, ISRAEL'S GENTLE SHEPHERD

```txt
1.
The Son of God proclaim,
The Lord of time and space;
The God who bade the light break forth
Now shines in Jesus’ face.

2.
Behold His out stretched hands,
Though all was in His power
He took the towel and basin then,
And serves us in this hour.

3.
He, God’s creative word,
The church’s Lord and head,
Here bids us gather as His friends,
And share His wine and bread.

4.
The Lord of life and death
With wondering praise we sing;
We break the bread at His command,
And name Him God and King.

5.
We take this cup in hope:
For He, who gladly bore
The shameful cross, is ris’n again,
And reigns forevermore.
