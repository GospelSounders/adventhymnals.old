## 426. O HOLY LORD, CONTENT TO FILL

```txt
1.
I shall see the King where the angels sing,
I shall see the King some day, in the better land,
On that golden strand,
And with Him shall ever stay.


2.
In the land of song, in the glory throng,
Where there never comes a night,
With my Lord once slain I shall ever reign
In the glory land of light.

3.
I shall see the King, all my tributes bring,
And shall look upon His face;
Then my song shall be how He ransomed me
And has kept me by His grace.
```
