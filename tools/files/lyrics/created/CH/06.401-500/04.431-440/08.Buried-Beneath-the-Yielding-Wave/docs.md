You will see your Lord a-coming,
You will see your Lord a-coming,
You will see your Lord a-coming
In a few more days.

Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet,
Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet,
Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet
In a few more days.

You will see the saints arising,
You will see the saints arising,
You will see the saints arising
In a few more days.

4.
Angels bear them to the Savior,
Angels bear them to the Savior,
Angels bear them to the Savior
In a few more days.

Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over,
Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over,
Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over
In a few more days.
