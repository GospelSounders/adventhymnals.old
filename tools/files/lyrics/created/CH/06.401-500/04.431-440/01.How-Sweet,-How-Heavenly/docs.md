## 431. HOW SWEET, HOW HEAVENLY

```txt
1.
Come let us sing of homeland,
Down by the crystal sea;
Wonderful land where Jesus
Buildeth a mansion for me.


2.
Water of life there floweth,
Fruit in abundant store;
Citizens of that country
Hunger and thirst never more.

3.
Come go with me to homeland,
Jesus invites you there;
Help spread the invitation,
Tell it to men everywhere.
```
