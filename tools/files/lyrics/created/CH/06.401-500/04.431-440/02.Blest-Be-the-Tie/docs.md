## 432. BLEST BE THE TIE

```txt
1.
Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

2.
Before our Father's throne
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

3.
We share each other's woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

4.
When we asunder part,
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.
```
