## 454. THE MORNING LIGHT

```txt
1.
The morning light is breaking, 
The darkness disappears; 
The sons of earth are waking 
To penitential tears; 
Each breeze that sweeps the ocean 
Brings tidings from afar 
Of nations in commotion, 
Prepared for Zion's war. 

2.
See heathen nations bending 
Before the God we love, 
And thousand hearts ascending 
In gratitude above; 
While sinners, now confessing, 
The gospel call obey, 
And seek the Saviour's blessing, 
A nation in a day. 

3.
Blest river of salvation, 
Pursue thy onward way; 
Flow thou to every nation, 
Nor in thy richness stay 
Stay not till all the lowly, 
Triumphant reach their home; 
Stay not till all the holy 
Proclaim, "The Lord is come!"
