## 454. THE MORNING LIGHT

```txt
1.
Don’t you see my Jesus coming,
See Him come in yonder cloud?
With ten thousand angels round Him,
How they do my Jesus crowd!


2.
Don’t you see the saints ascending,
Hear them shouting thro’ the air.
Jesus smiling, trumpets sounding,
Now His glory they shall share.
```
