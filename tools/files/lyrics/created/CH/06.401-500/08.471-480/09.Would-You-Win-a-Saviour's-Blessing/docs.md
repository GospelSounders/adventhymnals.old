## 479. WOULD YOU WIN A SAVIOUR'S BLESSING?

```txt
1.
Be silent, be silent, A whisper is heard;
Be silent, and listen, Oh treasure each word.


2.
Be silent, be silent, For holy this place,
This altar that echoes The message of grace.

3.
Be silent, be silent, Breathe humbly our prayer;
A foretaste of Eden This moment we share.

4.
Be silent, be silent, His mercy record;
Be silent, be silent, And wait on the Lord.
