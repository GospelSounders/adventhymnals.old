## 479. WOULD YOU WIN A SAVIOUR'S BLESSING?

```txt
1.
Would you win a Saviour's blessing? 
Freely, freely give; 
Would you see His work progressing? 
Freely, freely give; 
Let your souls with love expand, 
Open wide a liberal hand; 
Would you follow God's command? 
Freely, freely give. 

2.
With a cheerful heart and willing, 
Freely, freely give; 
Like the dew its balm distilling, 
Freely, freely give; 
Have you little? Give your mite; 
O how precious in His sight! 
He your offering will requite; 
Freely, freely give. 

3.
Give to spread the grand old story, 
Freely, freely give; 
Give to speed the light of glory. 
Freely, freely give; 
Would you gain a rich reward 
In the harvest of the Lord, 
Then obedient to His word. 
Freely, freely give.
