## 480. A YEAR OF PRECIOUS BLESSINGS

```txt
1.
A year of precious blessings, 
And glorious victories won, 
Of earnest work progressing, 
Its onward course has run; 
To Thee, O God, our Refuge, 
Whose goodness crowns our days, 
Within Thy earthly temple 
We lift our souls in praise; 
Within Thy earthly temple 
We lift our souls in praise. 

2.
Thou Master of assemblies, 
In mighty power descend, 
Behold our glad reunion, 
Conduct it to the end; 
Inspire our hearts with courage, 
And deeper love for Thee, 
That all Thy name may honor, 
Where'er our field may be; 
That all Thy name may honor, 
Where'er our field may be. 

3.
O church of God's Anointed, 
March on the lost to win, 
Lead forth Thy ranks victorious 
Against the hosts of sin; 
'Till at His throne in glory, 
Where angels prostrate fall, 
One hallelujah chorus 
Shall crown Him Lord of all; 
One hallelujah chorus 
Shall crown Him Lord of all.
```
