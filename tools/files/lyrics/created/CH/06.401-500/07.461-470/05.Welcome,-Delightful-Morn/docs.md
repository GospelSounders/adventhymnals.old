## 465. WELCOME, DELIGHTFUL MORN

```txt
1.
Welcome, delightful morn, 
Thou day of sacred rest! 
I hail thy kind return; 
Lord, make these moments blest; 
From the low plane of mortal toys 
I soar to reach immortal joys, 
I soar to reach immortal joys. 

2.
Now may the King descend, 
And fill His throne with grace; 
Thy scepter, Lord, extend, 
While saints address Thy face; 
Let sinners feel Thy quickening word, 
And learn to know and fear the Lord, 
And learn to know and fear the Lord. 

3.
Descend, celestial Dove, 
With all Thy quickening powers; 
Disclose a Saviour's love, 
And bless the sacred hours; 
Then shall my soul new life obtain, 
Nor Sabbaths be enjoyed in vain, 
Nor Sabbaths be enjoyed in vain.
```
