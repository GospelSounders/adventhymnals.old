## 463. O DAY OF REST AND GLADNESS

```txt
1.
Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.

2.
Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?
To do the will of Jesus: this is rest.

3.
Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?
In Jesusâ€™ keeping we are safe, and they.

4.
Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.
```
