## 461. THIS IS THE DAY OF REST

```txt
1.
This is the day of rest; 
Our failing strength renew; 
On weary brain and troubled breast 
Shed Thou Thy freshening dew. 

2.
This is the day of peace; 
Thy peace our spirits fill; 
Bid Thou the blasts of discord cease, 
The waves of strife be still. 

3.
This is the day of prayer; 
Let earth to heaven draw near; 
Lift up our hearts to seek Thee there; 
Come down to meet us here. 

4.
This is the best of days; 
Send forth Thy quickening breath, 
And wake dead souls to love and praise, 
O Vanquisher of death!
