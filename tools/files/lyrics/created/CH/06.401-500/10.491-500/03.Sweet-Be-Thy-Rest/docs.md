## 493. SWEET BE THY REST

```txt
1.
Like the woman at the well I was seeking
For things that could not satisfy:
And then I heard my Savior speaking:
” Draw from my well that never shall run dry”.


2.
There are millions in this world who are craving
The pleasures earthly things afford;
But none can match the wondrous treasure
That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.

3.
So, my brother, if the things this world gave you
Leave hungers that won’t pass away,
My blessed Lord will come and save you,
If you kneel to Him and humbly pray:
