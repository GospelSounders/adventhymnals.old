## 492. DARK IS THE HOUR

```txt
1.
Teach, me, Father, what to say;
Teach me, Father, how to pray;
Teach me all along the way
How to be like Jesus.


2.
Teach me as the days go by,
Teach me not to reason why,
Teach me that to do and die,
Is to be like Jesus.

3.
Teach me that the time is short,
Teach me how to live and work,
Teach me that to never shirk
Is to be like Jesus.

4.
Teach me how we may be one,
Like the Father and the Son;
And when all is overcome,
I will be like Jesus.
```
