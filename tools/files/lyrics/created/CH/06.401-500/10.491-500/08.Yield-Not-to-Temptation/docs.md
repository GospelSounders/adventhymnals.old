## 498. YIELD NOT TO TEMPTATION

```txt
1.
Yield not to temptation, 
For yielding is sin, 
Each victory will help you 
Some other to win; 
Fight manfully onward, 
Dark passions subdue, 
Look ever to Jesus, 
He'll carry you through. 

Refrain:
Ask the Saviour to help you, 
Comfort, strengthen, and keep you; 
He is willing to aid you, 
He will carry you through. 

2.
Shun evil companions, 
Bad language disdain, 
God's name hold in reverence, 
Nor take it in vain; 
Be thoughtful and earnest, 
Kindhearted and true, 
Look ever to Jesus, 
He'll carry you through. 

Refrain:
Ask the Saviour to help you, 
Comfort, strengthen, and keep you; 
He is willing to aid you, 
He will carry you through. 

3.
To him that o'ercometh 
God giveth a crown, 
Through faith we shall conquer, 
Though often cast down; 
He who is our Saviour 
Our strength will renew, 
Look ever to Jesus, 
He'll carry you through.

Refrain:
Ask the Saviour to help you, 
Comfort, strengthen, and keep you; 
He is willing to aid you, 
He will carry you through.
