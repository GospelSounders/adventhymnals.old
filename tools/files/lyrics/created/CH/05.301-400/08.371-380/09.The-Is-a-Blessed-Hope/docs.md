## 379. THE IS A BLESSED HOPE

```txt
1.
We give this child to You,
Our precious gift of love.
Help us to lead each step aright
With guidance from above.

2.
O bless each child of Yours,
And grant when they are grown,
They will have learned to love Your way,
And choose it for their own.

3.
We give ourselves to You,
And may Your Spirit fill
Our hearts and home, that all we do
Be subject to Your will.
