## 374. THERE IS A ROAD

```txt
1.
There is a road, though narrow and obscure, 
Which we must traverse till earth's days be past, 
Which though unheeded by the passing throng, 
Leads us to our eternal home at last. 

2.
Here trod the faithful when the work began; 
Some still are with us, but, alas, not all; 
Many have laid their heavy burdens down 
And will rejoin us when the Lord shall call. 

3.
And there is One who, though to eye unseen, 
Journeys besideus wheresoe'er we go; 
Guards all our footsteps with the tenderest care, 
And sorrows with us in our earthly woe. 

4.
Almost the city towers we can discern 
And hear the music from those courts above. 
Jesus is waiting with the table spread; 
O what a welcome in those arms of love.
