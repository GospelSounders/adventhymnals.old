## 353. FORWARD, CHRISTIAN, FORWARD!

```txt
1.
Forward, Christian, forward! spread abroad the cry; 
Shout aloud the watchword, "Jesus draweth nigh!" 
Wave the gospel standard, banner of His love; 
Sing, as marching onward to your home above. 

2.
Forward, Christian, forward! Christ thy life, thy song; 
Trust in "Jesus only," in His strength be strong; 
Christ, the glorious leader of the blood-bought band; 
Follow, closely follow, to the heavenly land. 

3.
Sound your hallelujahs, praise to Jesus bring; 
Magnify His glories, of His coming sing; 
Sing amidst the conflict, shout the battle cry: 
"Jesus Christ is coming; on to victory!" 

4.
Haste, thou glorious morning! Welcome, shadeless day! 
Chasing with thy sunlight all our tears away; 
Haste, O wondrous moment, when 'midst radiant skies 
Sleeping saints and living at His Word arise.
