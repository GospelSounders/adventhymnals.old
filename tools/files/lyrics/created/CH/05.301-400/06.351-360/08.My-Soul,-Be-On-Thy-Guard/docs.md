## 358. MY SOUL, BE ON THY GUARD

```txt
1.
Far and near the fields are teeming
with the sheaves of ripened grain;
Far and near their gold is gleaming
O’er the summy slope and plain.


2.
Send them forth with morn’s first beaming,
Send them in the noon-tides’s glare;
When the sun’s last rays are streaming,
bid them gather everywhere.

3.
O thou, whom thy Lord is sending,
gather now the sheaves of gold;
Heavenward then at evening wending
Thou shalt come with joy untold.
```
