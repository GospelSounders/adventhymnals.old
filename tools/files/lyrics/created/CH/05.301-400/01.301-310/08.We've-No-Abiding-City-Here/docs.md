## 308. WE'VE NO ABIDING CITY HERE

```txt
1.
I would be, dear Savior, wholly Thine;
Teach me how, teach me how;
I would do Thy will, O Lord, not mine;
Help me, help me now.


2.
What is worldly pleasure, wealth or fame,
Without Thee, without Thee?
I will leave them all for Thy dear Name,
This my wealth shall be.

3.
As I cast earth’s transient joys behind,
Come Thou near, come Thou near;
In Thy presence all in all I find,
’Tis my comfort here.
```
