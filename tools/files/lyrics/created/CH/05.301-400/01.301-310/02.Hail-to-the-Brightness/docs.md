## 302. HAIL TO THE BRIGHTNESS

```txt
1.
In the blood from the cross,
I have been washed from sin;
But to be free from dross,
Still I would enter in.


2.
Day by day, hour by hour,
Blessings are sent to me;
But for more of His power,
Ever my prayer shall be.

3.
Near to Christ I would live,
Following Him each day;
What I ask He will give;
So then with faith I pray.

4.
Now I have peace, sweet peace,
While in this world of sin;
But to pray Iâ€™ll not cease
Till I am pure within.
```
