## 302. HAIL TO THE BRIGHTNESS

```txt
1.
Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning! 
Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain! 
Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mourning; 
Zion, in triumph, begins her mild reign. 

2.
Lo, in the desert rich flowers are springing; 
Streams ever copious are gliding along; 
Loud, from the mountaintops echoes are ringing; 
Wastes rise in verdure, and mingle in song. 

3.
See, the dead risen from land and from ocean; 
Praise to Jehovah, ascending on high; 
Fallen the engines of war and commotion, 
Shouts of salvation are rending the sky. 
Reign, reign for aye.
```
