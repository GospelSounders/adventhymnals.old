## 310. O HAPPY DAY! THAT FIXED MY CHOICE

```txt
1.
O happy day! that fixed my choice 
On Thee, my Saviour and my God; 
Well may this glowing heart rejoice, 
And tell its raptures all abroad. 

Refrain:
Happy day, happy day, 
When Jesus washed my sins away! 
He taught me how to watch and pray, 
And live rejoicing every day; 
Happy day, happy day, 
When Jesus washed my sins away! 

2.
'Tis done, the great transaction's done; 
I am my Lord's, and He is mine; 
He drew me and I followed on, 
Charmed to confess the voice divine. 

Refrain:
Happy day, happy day, 
When Jesus washed my sins away! 
He taught me how to watch and pray, 
And live rejoicing every day; 
Happy day, happy day, 
When Jesus washed my sins away! 

3.
Now rest, my long-divided heart, 
Fixed on this blissful center, rest; 
Nor ever from thy Lord depart, 
With Him of every good possessed. 

Refrain:
Happy day, happy day, 
When Jesus washed my sins away! 
He taught me how to watch and pray, 
And live rejoicing every day; 
Happy day, happy day, 
When Jesus washed my sins away! 

4.
High Heaven, that heard the solemn vow, 
That vow renewed shall daily hear, 
Till in time's latest hour I bow, 
And bless at last a bond so dear. 

Refrain:
Happy day, happy day, 
When Jesus washed my sins away! 
He taught me how to watch and pray, 
And live rejoicing every day; 
Happy day, happy day, 
When Jesus washed my sins away! 

5.
And when the bright celestial train. 
From highest heaven to earth shall come; 
Then with my Lord I'll rise, and reign 
Forever in that happy home.

Refrain:
Happy day, happy day, 
When Jesus washed my sins away! 
He taught me how to watch and pray, 
And live rejoicing every day; 
Happy day, happy day, 
When Jesus washed my sins away!
