## 389. THOU ART,  O CHRIST, THE LIGHT AND LIFE

```txt
1.
Thou art, O Christ, the light and life 
Of all my soul's aspiring hope; 
Without that life in daily strife 
I could not dare with sin to cope. 

2.
I have not strength to stand alone, 
When storms of doubt and fears assail; 
But Thou, yea, Thou, and Thou alone, 
Must o'er my doubts and fears prevail. 

3.
I have not courage to resist, 
When Satan's hosts attack me sore; 
I must on Thee alone subsist, 
Till sin and sorrow reign no more. 

4.
And when, in that bright realm above, 
I see Thee ever face to face, 
I'll breathe the fragrance of Thy love, 
I'll sing the wonder of Thy grace.
