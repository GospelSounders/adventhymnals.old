## 387. HOW CHEERING IS THE CHRISTIAN'S HOPE

```txt
1.
Peace and healing on thy wing;
And to every troubled breast
Speak of the divine behest:
Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!

2.
Earthly longings bid retire,
Quench the passionsâ€™ hurtful fire;
To the wayward, sin oppressed,
Bring thou thy divine behest:
Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!

3.
Wipe from every cheek the tear,
Banish care and silence fear;
All things working for the best,
Teach us the divine behest:
Thou shalt rest, Thou shalt rest!
```
