## 398. JESUS, SAVIOUR, PILOT ME

```txt
1.
Bread of the world in mercy broken,
Wine of the soul in mercy shed,
By whom the words of life are spoken,
And in whose death our sins are dead;

2.
Look on the heart by sorrow broken,
Look on the tears by sinners shed;
And be Thy feast to us the token
That by Thy grace our souls are fed. Amen.
