## 399. THERE IS A SAFE AND SECRET PLACE

```txt
1.
There is a safe and secret place 
Beneath the wings divine, 
Reserved for all the heirs of grace; 
O, be that refuge mine! 

2.
The least and feeblest there may bide, 
Uninjured and unawed; 
While thousands fall on every side, 
He rests secure in God. 

3.
He feeds in pastures large and fair, 
Of love and truth divine; 
O child of God, 0 glory's heir! 
How rich a lot is thine! 

4.
A hand almighty to defend, 
An ear for every call, 
An honored life, a peaceful end, 
And heaven to crown it all.
