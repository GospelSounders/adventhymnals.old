## 329. SPEAK, LORD, IN THE STILLNESS

```txt
1.
Take the world, but give me Jesus;
All its Joys are but a name,
But His love abideth ever,
Through eternal years the same.


2.
Take the world, but give me Jesus,
Sweetest comfort of my soul;
With my Savior watching oâ€™er me,
I can sing, though billows roll.

3.
Take the world, but give me Jesus;
Let me view his constant smile;
Then throughout my pilgrim journey
Light will cheer me all the while.

4.
Take the world, but give me Jesus;
In His cross my trust shall be,
Till, with clearer, brighter vision
Face to face my Lord I see.
