## 362. LEAD ON, O KING ETERNAL

```txt
1.
Come, Christians, follow where our Captain trod,
Our King victorious, Christ, the Son of God.

2.
Led on their way by this triumphant sign,
The hosts of God in conquering ranks combine.

3.
All newborn soldiers of the Crucified
Bear on their brows the seal of Him Who died.

4.
O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,
As Thou hast promised, draw us all to Thee.

5.
So shall our song of triumph ever be:
Praise to the Crucified for victory!
