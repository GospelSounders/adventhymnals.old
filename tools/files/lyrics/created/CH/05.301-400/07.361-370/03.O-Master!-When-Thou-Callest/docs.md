## 363. O MASTER! WHEN THOU CALLEST

```txt
1.
O Master! When Thou Callest 
No voice may say Thee "Nay;" 
For blest are they that follow 
Where Thou dost lead the way; 
In freshest prime of morning, 
Or fullest glow of noon, 
The note of heavenly warning 
Can never come too soon. 

2.
O Master! When Thou Callest 
No foot may shrink in fear; 
For they who trust Thee wholly 
Shall find Thee ever near; 
And chamber still and lonely, 
Or busy harvest field, 
Where Thou, Lord, rulest only, 
Shall precious produce yield. 

3.
O Master! When Thou Callest 
No heart may dare refuse; 
'Tis honor, highest honor 
Where Thou dost deign to use 
Our brightest and our fairest, 
Our dearest-all are Thine; 
Thou who for each one carest, 
We hail Thy love's design. 

4.
They who go forth to serve Thee, 
We, too, who serve at home, 
May watch and pray together 
Until Thy kingdom come. 
In Thee for aye united, 
Our song of hope we raise, 
Till that blest shore is sighted. 
Where all shall turn to praise!
