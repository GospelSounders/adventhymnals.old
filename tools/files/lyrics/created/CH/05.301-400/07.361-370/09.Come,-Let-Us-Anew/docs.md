## 369. COME, LET US ANEW

```txt
1.
Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,
Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve,
Waiting for the harvest and the time of reaping –
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.


2.
Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,
Fearing neither clouds nor winter’s chilling breeze;
By and by the harvest and the labor ended –
We shall come rejoicing, bringin in the sheaves.

3.
Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master,
Tho the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;
When our weeping’s over He will bid us welcome –
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves
