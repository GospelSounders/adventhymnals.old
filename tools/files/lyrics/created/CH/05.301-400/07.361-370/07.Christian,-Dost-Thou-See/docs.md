## 367. CHRISTIAN, DOST THOU SEE?

```txt
1.
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
weep oâ€™er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.


2.
Though they are slighting him, still he is waiting,
waiting the penitent child to receive;
plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
he will forgive if they only believe.

3.
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;
strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
back to the narrow way patiently win them;
tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died.
