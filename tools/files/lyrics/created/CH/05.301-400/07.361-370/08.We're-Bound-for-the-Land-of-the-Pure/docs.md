## 368. WE'RE BOUND FOR THE LAND OF THE PURE

```txt
1.
Watchman, blow the gospel trumpet,
Every soul a warning give;
Whosoever hears the message
May repent, and, turn and live.


2.
Sound it loud oér every hilltop,
Gloomy shade and sunny plain;
Ocean depths repeat the message,
Full salvation’s glad refrain.

3.
Sound it in the hedge and highway,
Earth’s dark spots where exiles roam;
Let it tell all things are ready,
Father waits to welcome home.

4.
Sound it for the heavy laden,
Weary, longing to be free;
Sound a Savior’s invitation,
Sweetly saying, “Come to me.”
