## 332. MY HEART IS RESTING

```txt
1.
Oh now I see the crimson wave,
The fountain deep and wide;
Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,
Points to His wounded side.


2.
I see the new creation rise,
I hear the speaking blood;
It speaks polluted nature dies,
Sinks ‘neath the cleansing flood.

3.
I rise to walk in heaven’s own light,
Above the world and sin;
With heart made pure and garments white,
And Christ enthroned within.

4.
Amazing grace! ’tis heaven below
To feel the blood applied,
And Jesus, only Jesus, know,
My Jesus crucified.
