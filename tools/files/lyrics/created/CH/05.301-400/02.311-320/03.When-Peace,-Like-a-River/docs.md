## 313. WHEN PEACE, LIKE A RIVER

```txt
1.
Just as I am, without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

2.
Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

3.
Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
“Fightings within, and fears without,”
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

4.
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

5.
Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

6.
Just as I am, Thy love I own
Has broken every barrier down;
Now, to be Thine, and Thine alone,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
