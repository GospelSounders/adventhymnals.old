## 311. PEACE, PERFECT PEACE

```txt
1.
Earthly pleasures vainly call me;
I would be like Jesus;
Nothing worldly shall enthrall me;
I would be like Jesus.


2.
He has broken every fetter,
I would be like Jesus;
That my soul may serve Him better,
I would be like Jesus.

3.
All the way from earth to glory,
I would be like Jesus;
Telling o’er and o’er the story,
I would be like Jesus.

4.
That in Heaven He may meet me,
I would be like Jesus;
That His words “Well done” may greet me,
I would be like Jesus.
```
