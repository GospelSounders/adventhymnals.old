010 - Praise, O Praise Our God and King!

1.
Praise, O praise our God and King! 
Hymns of adoration sing; 
For His mercies still endure, 
Ever faithful, ever sure. 

2.
Praise Him that He made the sun 
Day by day his course to run, 
And the silver moon by night, 
Shining with her gentle light. 

3.
Praise Him for our harvest store; 
He hath filled the garner floor; 
And for richer food than this, 
Pledge of everlasting bliss.
