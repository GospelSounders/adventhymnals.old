357 - Christian, Seek Not Repose
Major Key: E Flat

1.
Christian, seek not yet repose, Cast thy dreams of ease away;
Thou art in the midst of foes; Watch and pray!

2.
Gird thy heavenly armor on, Wear it ever, night and day;
Ambushed lies the evil one; Watch and pray!

3.
Hear the victors who o'ercame; Still they mark each warrior's way;
All with one sweet voice exclaim: Watch and pray!

4.
Hear, above all, hear thy Lord, Him thou lovest to obey;
Hide within thy heart His word; Watch and pray!

5.
Watch, as if on that alone Hung the issue of the day;
Pray that help may be sent down; Watch and pray!
