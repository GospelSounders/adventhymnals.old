333 - Father, Whate'er of Earthly Bliss 

1.
Father, whate'er of earthly bliss 
Thy sovereign will denies, 
Accepted at Thy throne of grace 
Let this petition rise. 

2.
Give me a calm, a thankful, heart, 
From every murmur free; 
The blessings of Thy grace impart, 
And make me live to Thee. 

3.
Let the sweet hope that Thou art mine 
My life and death attend: 
Thy presence through my journey shine, 
And crown my journey's end.
