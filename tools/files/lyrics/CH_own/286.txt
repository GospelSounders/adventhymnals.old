286 - I Come to Thee, O Father 

1.
I come to Thee, O Father, 
Confessing all my sin; 
I come and claim Thy promise; 
Come in, dear Lord, come in. 

2.
Drive out my sinful nature, 
Implant Thine own, I pray; 
And wash and cleanse and save me 
Each moment, hour and day. 

3.
O send Thy Holy Spirit 
To guide me, I implore; 
For Jesus' sake, O make me 
Thy child forevermore.
