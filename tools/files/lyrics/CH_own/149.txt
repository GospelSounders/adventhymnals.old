149 - O Gift of God, We Praise Thee 

1.
O Gift of God, we praise Thee, 
That ever Thou didst come 
To guide our wayward footsteps 
Back to the Father's home. 

2.
O Gift of God, we take Thee 
To be our All in All; 
We know Thou art sufficient 
Whatever may befall. 

3.
O Gift of God, we give Thee 
Ourselves, Thine own to be; 
Accept us, save and keep us 
Throughout eternity.
