662 - Let Others Seek a Home Below 

1.
Let others seek a home below, 
We'll be gathered home; 
Which flames devour or waves o'er throw, 
We'll be gathered home. 
Refrain:
We'll work till Jesus comes, 
We'll work till Jesus comes, 
We'll work till Jesus comes, 
And we'll be gathered home. 

2.
Be mine the happier lot to own, 
We'll be gathered home; 
A heavenly mansion near the throne, 
We'll be gathered home. 

3.
Then, fail this earth, let stars decline, 
We'll be gathered home; 
And sun and moon refuse to shine, 
We'll be gathered home. 

4.
Though desolation here may be, 
We'll be gathered home; 
That heavenly mansion stands for me, 
We'll be gathered home.
