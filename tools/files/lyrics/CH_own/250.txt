250 - When, My Saviour, Shall I Be

1.
When, my Saviour, shall I be 
Perfectly resigned to Thee? 
Poor and vile in my own eyes, 
Only in thy wisdom wise. 

2.
Only thee content to know, 
Ignorant of all below; 
Only guided by thy light, 
Only mighty in thy might? 

3.
Fully in my life express 
All the heights of holiness; 
Sweetly let my spirit prove 
All the depths of humble love.
