028 Blest Hour When Mortal Man Retires

1.
Blest hour when mortal man retires 
To hold communion with his God, 
To send to heaven his warm desires, 
And listen to the sacred word. 

2.
Blest hour when earthly cares resign 
Their empire o'er his anxious breast; 
While all around, the calm divine 
Proclaims the holy day of rest. 

3.
Blest hour when God Himself draws nigh, 
Well pleased His people's voice to hear, 
To hush the penitential sigh, 
And wipe away the mourner's tear. 

4.
Blest hour! for where the Lord resorts 
Foretastes of future bliss are given; 
And mortals find His earthly courts 
The house of God, the gate of heaven.
