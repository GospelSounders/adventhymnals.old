511 - Gentle Peace, From Heaven Descended 

1.
Gentle Peace, from heaven descended, 
We would live beneath Thy law; 
Thou hast home and life befriended, 
Born of nobler deeds than war. 

2.
Thou hast thrown a smile of beauty 
O'er the meadow, hill, and grove; 
Thou hast quickened us to duty, 
Thou hast warmed our hearts to love. 

3.
Stay Thou with us, still replenish 
Fields with fruit, ourselves with love; 
Discord and dissension banish, 
Peaceful Spirit from above.
