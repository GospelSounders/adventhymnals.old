214 - Our Blest Redeemer 

1.
Our blest Redeemer, ere he breathed 
His tender last farewell, 
A Guide, a Comforter, bequeathed 
With us to dwell. 

2.
He came sweet influence to impart, 
A gracious, willing Guest, 
While he can find one humble heart 
Wherein to rest. 

3.
And his that gentle voice we hear, 
Soft as the breath of even, 
That checks the wrong, that calms the fear, 
And speaks of Heaven. 

4.
And every virtue we possess, 
And every victory won, 
And every thought of holiness 
Are his alone. 

5.
Spirit of purity and grace, 
Our weakness, pitying, see; 
O make our hearts thy dwelling place, 
Till all like thee.
