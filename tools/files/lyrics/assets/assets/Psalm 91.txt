"Psalm 91" 

** I dwell in the secret place of the most High , I abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
** I will of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.
** Surely he shall deliver me and my family from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.
**  He shall cover me and my family with his feathers, and under his wings shalt we trust: his truth shall
    be thy shield and buckler.
**  We shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
**  Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
**  A thousand shall fall at my side, and ten thousand at my right hand; but it shall not come nigh me and my family.

**  Only with my eyes shalt I behold and see the reward of the wicked.
  Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;
**  There shall no evil befall me and my family, neither shall any plague come nigh our dwelling.
**  For he has given his angels charge over me and my family, to keep me and my family in all our ways.
**  They shall bear me and my family up in their hands, lest we dash our feet against a stone.
**  We shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt we trample under feet.
Psa 91:14  Because we have set our love upon him, therefore the Lord will  deliver us:
        He will set us on high, because we have known his name.
**  We shall call upon him, and He will answer us: He will be with us in trouble; He will deliver me and my family, and honour us.
**  With long life will He satisfy us, and shew me and my family His salvation.

    In Jesus Name. Amen and Amen
