615 - Rise Up, O Church of God

Major Key: B Flat

1.
Rise up, O men of God!
His kingdom tarries long.
Bring in the day of brotherhood
And end the night of wrong.

2.
Let women all rise up!
Have done with lesser things.
Give heart and mind and soul and strength
To serve the King of kings.

3.
Rise up, courageous youth!
The church for you doth wait,
Her strength unequal to her task;
Rise up, and make her great!

4.
Lift high the cross of Christ!
Tread where His feet have trod.
Disciples of the Son of Man,
Rise up, O church of God!
