312 - Weeping Endures But for a Night 

1.
Weeping endures but for a night, 
Joy cometh with the morning light; 
Joy cometh of celestial birth, 
Unsullied by the blight of earth. 

2.
Joy comes each faithful heart to thrill, 
That fears of change no more will chill; 
Transporting joy, that fills the soul 
While everlasting ages roll. 

3.
Then, mourning pilgrim, upward gaze; 
Beyond this dark and thorny maze 
A joy for every tear is found, 
A healing balm for every wound. 

4.
No sorrow there shall dim the eye, 
No wintry winds or storms are nigh, 
No sighs borne on the fragrant air; 
But all shall in the glory share. 

5.
Awake, for, lo, not distant far, 
The rising of the Morning Star; 
O watch to catch the newborn ray 
That ushers in a cloudless day. 

6.
Hail! glorious morn, whose radiant light 
Shall bid the darkness take its flight; 
Shall chase the shades of gloom away, 
And night be turned to endless day.
