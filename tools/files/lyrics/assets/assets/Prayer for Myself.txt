I am What God says I am. I believe it and I declare It and  According to Job 22:28 It is established for me in my life in Jesus name.

I am a child of God, God loves me and I  love him too and like Christ I please my Father.I do not do things to be loved by Him.

Therefore sin has no power over me I separate myself from every unclean thing I submit myself to God. I resist the devil and he flees from me. \n Everyday God by his word is changing me into the perfect image of Jesus my Lord so that As He is so I am here on earth. 1 John 4:17

I cast down imaginations and every thought that tries to exalt itself against the knowledge of God. I bring my thoughts into captivity to the obedience of Christ and His Word.

I think on things that are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report. If there be any virtue or praise, I think on these things .

In righteousness I am established.I am far from oppression. I do not fear.I am far from terror. It will not come near me - Isaiah 54:14.

No weapon formed against me shall prosper and every tongue that rises against me is condemned or shown to be wrong and stopped. This is the heritage God has given me as a servant of the Lord and my righteousness is of Him .
