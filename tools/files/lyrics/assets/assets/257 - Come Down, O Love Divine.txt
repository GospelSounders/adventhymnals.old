257 - Come Down, O Love Divine

Major Key: D

1
Come down, O Love divine, seek Thou this soul of mine
And visit it with Thine own ardor glowing;
O Comforter, draw near, within my heart appear,
And kindle it, Thy holy flame bestowing.

2
O let it freely burn, till earthly passions turn
To dust and ashes in its heat consuming;
And let Thy glorious light shine ever on my sight,
And clothe me round, the while my path illuming.

3
Let holy charity Mine outward vesture be,
And lowliness become my inner clothing;
True lowliness of heart which takes the humbler part,
And o'er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.

4
And so the yearning strong with which the soul will long
Shall far outpass the power of human telling;
For none can guess its grace, till Love create a place
Wherein the Holy Spirit makes a dwelling.
