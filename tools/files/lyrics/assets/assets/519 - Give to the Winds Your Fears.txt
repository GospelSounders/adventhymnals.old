519 - Give to the Winds Your Fears

Major Key: B Flat

1
Give to the winds your fears; 
In hope be undismayed:
God hears your sighs and counts your tears,
God shall lift up your head.

2
To Him commit your griefs; 
Your ways put in His hands
To His sure truth and tender care
Who earth and heaven commands.

3
O put your trust in God; 
In duty's path go on.
Walk in His strength with faith and hope,
So shall your work be done.

4
Leave to His sovereign sway
To choose and to command;
So you shall, faithful, seek His way--
How wise, how strong His hand!
