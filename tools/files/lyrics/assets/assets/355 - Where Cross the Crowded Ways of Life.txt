355 - Where Cross the Crowded Ways of Life

Major Key: A Flat

1
Where cross the crowded ways of life,
Where sound the cries of race and clan,
Above the noise of selfish strife,
We hear your voice, O Son of Man.

2
From tender childhood's helplessness,
From woman's grief, man's burdened toil,
From famished souls, from sorrow's stress,
Your heart has never known recoil.

3
The cup of water given for You still
Holds the freshness of Your grace;
Yet long these multitudes to view
The sweet compassion of Your face.

4
O Master, from the mountainside
Make haste to heal these hearts of pain;
Among these restless throngs abide;
O tread the city's streets again.

5
Till all the world shall learn Your love
And follow where Your feet have trod,
Till, glorious from Your heaven above,
Shall come the city of our God.
