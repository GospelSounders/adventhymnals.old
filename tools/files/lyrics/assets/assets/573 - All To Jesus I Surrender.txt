573 - All To Jesus I Surrender


1.
All to Jesus I surrender;
All to him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live.

Refrain:
I surrender all, I surrender all,
All to Thee, my blessed Savior,
I surrender all.

2.
All to Jesus I surrender;
Humbly at His feet I bow,
Worldly pleasures all forsaken;
Take me, Jesus, take me now.

3.
All to Jesus I surrender;
Make me, Savior, wholly thine;
Fill me with Thy love and power;
Truly know that Thou art mine.

4.
All to Jesus I surrender;
Now I feel the sacred flame.
O the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory, to His name!
