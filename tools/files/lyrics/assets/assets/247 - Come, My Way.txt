247 - Come, My Way

Major Key: B flat

1
Come, my Way, my Truth, my Life: 
Such a Way as gives us breath; 
Such a Truth as ends all strife, 
Such a Life as killeth death. 

2
Come, my Light, my Feast, my Strength: 
Such a Light as shows a feast, 
Such a Feast as mends in length, 
Such a Strength as makes his guest. 

3
Come, my Joy, my Love, my Heart: 
Such a Joy as none can move, 
Such a Love as none can part, 
Such a Heart as joys in love.
