454 - Don't You See My Jesus Coming

Major Key: D

1
Don't you see my Jesus coming,
See Him come in yonder cloud?
With ten thousand angels round Him,
How they do my Jesus crowd!

CHORUS:
I am bound for the kingdom,
Will you go to glory with me?
Hallelujah! O praise ye the Lord!

2
Don't you see the saints ascending,
Hear them shouting thro' the air.
Jesus smiling, trumpets sounding,
Now His glory they shall share.


454
