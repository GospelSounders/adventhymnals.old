425 - Holy, Holy, Is What the Angels Sing

Major Key: D

1
There is singing up in heaven
Such as we have never known,
Where the angels sing the praises
Of the Lamb upon the throne;
Their sweet harps are ever tuneful
And their voices always clear,
O that we might be more like them
While we serve the Master here!

CHORUS:
Holy, holy, is what the angels sing,
And I expect to help them make
The courts of heaven ring;
But when I sing redemption's story,
They will fold their wings,
For angels never felt the joys
That our salvation brings.

2
But I hear another anthem,
Blending voices clear and strong,
Unto Him who hath redeemed us
And hath bought us, is the song;
We have come thro' tribulations
To this land so fair and bright,
In the fountain freely flowing
He hath made our garments white.

3
Then the angels stand and listen,
For they cannot join that song,
Like the sound of many waters,
By that happy, blood-washed throng;
For they sing about great trials,
Battles fought and vict'ries won,
And they praise their great Redeemer,
Who hath said to them, Well done.

4
So, although I'm not an angel,
Yet I know that over there
I will join a blessed chorus
That the angels cannot share;
I will sing about my Savior,
Who upon dark Calvary
Freely pardoned my transgressions,
Died to set the sinner free.
