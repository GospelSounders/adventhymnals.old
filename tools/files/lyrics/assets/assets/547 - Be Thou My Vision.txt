Major Key: E Flat

1
Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
Naught be all else to me, Save that Thou art
Thou my best Thought, By day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

2
Be Thou my Wisdom, And Thou my true Word;
I ever with Thee Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

3
Riches I heed not, Nor man's empty praise,
Thou mine Inheritance, Now and always:
Thou and Thou only, First in my heart,
High King of Heaven, My Treasure Thou art.

4
High King of Heaven, When victory won,
May I reach Heaven's joys, O bright Heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, Whatever befall,
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.
