575 - Let Your Heart Be Broken

Major Key: F

1
Let your heart be broken For a world in need:
Feed the mouths that hunger, Soothe the wounds that bleed,
Give the cup of water And the loaf of bread
Be the hands of Jesus, Serving in His stead.

2
Here on earth applying Principles of love,
Visible expression God still rules above
Living illustration Of the Living Word
To the minds of all who've Never seen or heard.

3
Blest to be a blessing Privileged to care,
Challenged by the need--Apparent everywhere.
Where mankind is wanting, Fill the vacant place.
Be the means through which the Lord reveals His grace.

4
Add to your believing Deeds that prove it true,
Knowing Christ as Savior, Make Him Master, too.
Follow in His footsteps, Go where He has trod;
In the world's great trouble Risk yourself for God.

5
Let your heart be tender And your vision clear;
See mankind as God sees, Serve Him far and near.
Let your heart be broken By a brother's pain;
Share your rich resources, Give and give again.
