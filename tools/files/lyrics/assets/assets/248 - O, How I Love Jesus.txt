248 - O, How I Love Jesus

Major Key: G

1
There is a Name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in my ears,
The sweetest Name on earth.

CHORUS:
O how I love Jesus,
O how I love Jesus,
O how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me.

2
It tells me of a Savior's love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of a Savior's blood,
The sinners' perfect plea.

3
It tells of one whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe;
Who in each sorrow bears a part 
That none can bear below.
