577 - In the Heart of Jesus

Major Key: F

1.
In the heart of Jesus There is love for you,
Love most pure and tender, Love most deep and true;
Why should you be lonely, Why for friendship sigh,
When the heart of Jesus Has a full supply?

2.
In the mind of Jesus There is thought for you,
Warm as summer sunshine, Sweet as morning dew;
Why should you be fearful, Why take anxious thought,
Since the mind of Jesus Cares for those He bought?

3.
In the field of Jesus There is work for you;
Such as even angels Might rejoice to do;
Why stand idly sighing For some lifework grand,
While the field of Jesus Seeks your reaping hand?

4.
In the home of Jesus There's a place for you;
Glorious, bright, and joyous, Calm and peaceful too;
Why then, like a wanderer, Roam with weary pace,
If the home of Jesus Holds for you a place?
