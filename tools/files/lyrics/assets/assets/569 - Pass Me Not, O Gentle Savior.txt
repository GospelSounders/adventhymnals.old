569 - Pass Me Not, O Gentle Savior

Major Key: G

1
Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

CHORUS:
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

2
Let me at Thy throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief,
Kneeling there in deep contrition;
Help my unbelief.

3
Trusting only in thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

4
Thou the spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me,
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heaven but Thee?
