581 - When the Church of Jesus

Major Key: F

1
When the church of Jesus Shuts its outer door,
Lest the roar of traffic Drown the voice of prayer:
May our prayers, Lord make us Ten times more aware
That the world we banish Is our Christian care.

2
If our hearts are lifted Where devotion soars
High above this hungry Suffering world of ours:
Lest our hymns should drug us To forget its needs,
Forge our Christian worship Into Christian deeds.

3
Lest the gifts we offer, Money, talents, time,
Serve to salve our conscience To our secret shame:
Lord, reprove, inspire us By the way You give;
Teach us, dying Savior, How true Christians live.
