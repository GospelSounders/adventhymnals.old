426 - I Shall See the King

Major Key: A Flat

1
I shall see the King Where the angels sing,
I shall see the King some day, In the better land,
On that golden strand,
And with Him shall ever stay.

CHORUS:
In His glory, I shall see the King,
And forever endless praises sing;
Twas on Calvary Jesus died for me;
I shall see the King someday.

2
In the land of song, In the glory throng,
Where there never comes a night,
With my Lord once slain I shall ever reign
In the glory land of light.

3
I shall see the King, All my tributes bring,
And shall look upon His face;
Then my song shall be How He ransomed me
And has kept me by His grace.
