585 - When Christ Was Lifted From the Earth

Major Key: D

1.
When Christ was lifted from the earth His arms stretched out above
Through every culture, every birth, To draw an answering love.

2.
Still east and west His love extends And always, near or far,
He calls and claims us as His friends And loves us as we are.

3.
Where generation, class, or race Divides us to our shame,
He sees not labels but a face, A person and a name.

4.
Thus freely loved, tho' fully known, May I in Christ be free
To welcome and accept His own As Christ accepted me.
