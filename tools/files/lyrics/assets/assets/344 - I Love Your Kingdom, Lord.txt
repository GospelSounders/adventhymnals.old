344 - I Love Your Kingdom, Lord

Major Key: F

1
I love Thy kingdom, Lord, 
The house of Thine abode, 
The church our blest Redeemer saved 
With His own precious blood. 

2
I love Thy church, O God! 
Her walls before Thee stand 
Dear as the apple of Thine eye, 
And graven on Thy hand. 

3
Beyond my highest joy 
I prize her heavenly ways, 
Her sweet communion, solemn vows, 
Her hymns of love and praise. 

4
Sure as Thy truth shall last, 
To Zion shall be given 
The brightest glories earth can yield, 
And brighter bliss of heaven.
