Lord, Sharpen my spiritual sensitivity
to see that which is not visible in the physical,
to hear that which is not audible to the flesh,
sense that which is not tangible to my physical senses,
believe that which is unbelievable.
Teach me to recognize your voice amidst
the many voices of this world, to hear and discern Your powerful,
wonderful, pure, precious voice and as a sheep with the shepherd, Lord give me grace to diligently obey your voice today in Jesus name.

Today I will live for Jesus. I can do all things through him who gives me strength. IN JESUS NAME. AMEN!!
