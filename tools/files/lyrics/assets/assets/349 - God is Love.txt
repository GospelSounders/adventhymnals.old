349 - God is Love

Major Key: C

1
Here in Christ we gather,
Love of Christ our calling.
Christ, our love, is with us,
Gladness be His greeting
Let us fear Him, yes, and love Him,
God eternal.
Loving Him, let each love
Christ in all his brethren.

CHORUS:
God is love, and where true love is
God Himself is there.

2
When we Christians gather, 
Members of one body,
Let there be in us no
Discord but one spirit.
Banished now be anger,
Strife, and every quarrel.
Christ, our God, be always
Present here among us.

3
Grant us love's fulfillment,
Joy with all the blessed,
When we see Your face,
O Savior, in its glory.
Shine on us, O purest
Light of all creation,
Be our bliss while endless
Ages sing Your praises.
