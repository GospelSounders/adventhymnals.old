283 - O Jesus, Thou Art Standing

Major Key: D

1
O Jesus, Thou art standing,
Outside the fast closed door,
In lowly patience waiting
To pass the threshold o'er:
O shame, professing Christians,
His Name and sign who bear,
O shame, thrice shame upon us,
To keep Him standing there!

2
O Jesus, Thou art knocking;
And lo, that hand is scarred,
And thorns Thy brow encircle,
And tears Thy face have marred:
O love that passeth knowledge,
So patiently to wait!
O sin that hath no equal,
So fast to bar the gate!

3
O Jesus, Thou art pleading
In accents meek and low,
I died for you, My children,
And will you treat Me so?
O Lord, with shame and sorrow
We open now the door;
Sear Savior, enter, enter,
And leave us never more.
