658 - They Brought Their Gifts to Jesus 


1.
They brought their gifts to Jesus, 
And laid them at His feet, 
And love for this dear Saviour, 
Made every offering sweet; 
Good deeds and words of kindness, 
Help for the poor of earth, 
And not a gift among them 
Was thought of little worth. 

Refrain :
Wouldst bring a gift to Jesus, 
That He will count most sweet? 
Say, "Lord, my heart I give Thee," 
And lay it at His feet. 

2.
Apart from other givers 
A poor wayfarer stood; 
He saw the gifts they offered, 
The poorest counted good; 
And he was filled with longing, 
A gift, though poor, to bring; 
Alas! all empty handed 
He stood before the King. 

3.
"Dear Lord," he cried in sorrow, 
"I know how kind Thou art, 
Take all I have to give Thee, 
My sinful wayward heart." 
Then Jesus answered softly, 
"Count not the gift as small, 
Though all of them are precious, 
Thine is the best of all."
